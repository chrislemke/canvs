## Part 3: Implications for CANVS Strategy

### Why Build a Mobile App NOW vs Wait for Glasses?

#### 1. The Data Asset Imperative

**Location data is the new oil for spatial computing.**

- Google's Visual Positioning System (VPS) is built on 15+ years of Street View imagery
- Snap Map has 400M+ MAU - their "critical asset" for wearables strategy
- **First-mover advantage:** Apps collecting location behavior, venue data, and spatial preferences NOW will have the training data that powers glasses experiences LATER

**What CANVS should collect on mobile:**
- User location patterns and preferences
- Venue/place metadata and ratings
- Social connection graphs tied to locations
- User-generated content anchored to places
- Movement patterns and "moments" data

#### 2. User Behavior Training

Glasses won't change fundamental user desires - they'll enhance existing behaviors:
- People already want to know where friends are
- Discovery of places is an established use case
- Check-ins and location sharing are proven behaviors

**Mobile-first lets you:**
- Validate core value propositions
- Build user habits that transfer to glasses
- Establish brand and community before the hardware land-grab

#### 3. Network Effects Compound

Social apps require critical mass. Starting in 2026 means:
- 2-3 years of network building before glasses go mainstream
- Established user base when new hardware launches
- App can be "day one" on new platforms (Apple Glasses, Android XR)

#### 4. The Platform Race Is Unsettled

| Platform | Certainty | Risk |
|----------|-----------|------|
| iOS (iPhone) | Very High | None - 1B+ devices |
| Android | Very High | None - 3B+ devices |
| visionOS | Medium | Low adoption, may pivot |
| Android XR | High | Not launched yet |
| Snap Specs | Medium | Snap ecosystem lock-in |

**Hedging strategy:** Build cross-platform mobile first, then expand to spatial when platforms stabilize.

### How to Design Mobile Experiences That Translate to Glasses

#### 1. Think "Glanceable"

Glasses UI = micro-interactions. Design mobile features that work in <5 seconds:
- Who's nearby? (one tap answer)
- Where should I go? (instant recommendation)
- What's happening here? (ambient awareness)

#### 2. Prioritize Audio & Haptics

Ray-Ban Meta's success is audio-first. Design features that work eyes-free:
- Voice-activated check-ins
- Audio notifications for friend proximity
- Haptic feedback for spatial awareness

#### 3. Build Location Intelligence

Glasses will need:
- Precise indoor positioning (work on VPS integration NOW)
- Semantic understanding of places (is this a cafe? park? venue?)
- Temporal patterns (busy times, events, vibe shifts)

**Mobile app can collect this data today for glasses experiences tomorrow.**

#### 4. Create Spatial Content Anchors

User-generated content should be:
- Tied to specific GPS coordinates
- Tagged with altitude/floor level when possible
- Timestamped for temporal relevance
- Linkable to visual positioning anchors later

### What Content/Data Assets Will Be Valuable When Glasses Arrive?

#### Tier 1: Critical Assets

| Asset | Why It Matters | Collection Method |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Social Graph + Location** | Friends' locations is killer app for glasses | Core mobile feature |
| **Venue Database** | Anchor points for AR content | User check-ins, integrations |
| **User Behavior Patterns** | Predictive recommendations | Passive location tracking |
| **Place "Vibe" Data** | Mood/context of locations | User ratings, temporal data |

#### Tier 2: High-Value Assets

| Asset | Why It Matters | Collection Method |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Indoor Maps** | Interior navigation crucial for glasses | Crowdsourced, partnerships |
| **Event/Moment Data** | Time-bounded spatial experiences | User posts, calendar integration |
| **Visual Anchors** | Recognize places for AR overlay | Photo uploads with GPS |
| **Movement Corridors** | Common paths between places | Aggregate anonymized data |

#### Tier 3: Future-Proofing Assets

| Asset | Why It Matters | Collection Method |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| **3D Place Scans** | Ready for spatial rendering | LiDAR capture features |
| **Audio Signatures** | Ambient sound of places | Optional audio capture |
| **Cross-Platform IDs** | User identity across devices | Account system design |

### How to Position for the Glass-Native Future

#### 1. Platform Partnerships (2026-2027)

Prioritize relationships with:
- **Snap:** Niantic Spatial integration, Lens Studio, Specs launch partner
- **Google/Android XR:** First-wave app for Warby Parker glasses
- **Meta:** Ray-Ban Meta app ecosystem
- **Apple:** visionOS app when Vision Pro gets spatial social features

#### 2. Technical Architecture Decisions

**Build now with glasses in mind:**
```
Mobile App (2026)
    |
    v
Cross-Platform Location Services Layer
    |
    ├── iOS/Android (current)
    ├── visionOS (2026-2027)
    ├── Android XR (2027)
    └── Proprietary glasses (2027+)
```

**Key technical choices:**
- Use ARCore Geospatial API for location anchoring (works on glasses later)
- Build around Niantic Lightship / VPS for cross-platform spatial persistence
- Store location data in formats compatible with spatial computing (not just lat/long)

#### 3. Brand Positioning

Position CANVS as "location intelligence" not just "location sharing":
- Glasses users will want smart, contextual, ambient information
- "What should I know about this place?" > "Where are my friends?"
- Build reputation for privacy-respecting location features (critical for always-on glasses)
