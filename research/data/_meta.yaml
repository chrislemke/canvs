  This folder contains extensive research on how CANVS can become a data-driven
  company. The overview.md document provides a comprehensive strategy covering:
  data collection, processing, database technologies, analytics tools,
  monetization, and growth. Key insights: PostgreSQL with extensions (PostGIS,
  H3, pgvector, TimescaleDB) serves as the Swiss Army knife for MVP. Graph
  databases (Neo4j) become important for the "Meaning Graph" at scale. The
  North Star metric is MPI/week (Meaningful Place Interactions). Free/open-source
  tools can support growth to 100K+ users before significant investment needed.
