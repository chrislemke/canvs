`research/gps_precision/intro.md` Should contain research on the topic of GPS precision in a web app/minimal viable product, as in this project. To understand the project in more detail, look at the following file. vision/product_vision_paper.md Since GPS precision is quite a topic for this project, we need to do extensive and detailed research on how this can be improved for projects like this. You should do research in two directions:
1. First, how to improve the precision for GPS while not straining the battery and providing the best user experience for web apps written in Node.js.
2. The other one asks the same question but for iOS and Android devices.So your task is to do deep web research on this topic: How can we approach the problem of GPS precision? What modern technologies are there? What opportunities? What is the industry standard, and what is state of the art to conquer this issue? In general, what is the best way to implement GPS? What do we have to think about? What is important to know? What challenges there are? What issues there are? Create an extremely rich and detailed comprehensive documentation about those topics and everything else which is relevant if we want to implement GPS into our project. Use as many agents as you want. Probably you should concentrate on research agents and analysts or analytic agents. The mode should be Mesh so all knowledge is shared. So now create those research documents using Claude Flow swarms.
