name: CANVS
tagline: "The end of the feed. The beginning of the world."

description: >
  CANVS is a persistent, AR-native social layer anchored to physical places.
  Instead of consuming content through feeds, people experience it where it
  belongs: at the location it refers to, at the scale it happened, with the
  atmosphere that gave it meaning. The planet becomes an addressable surface.

repo_purpose: >
  This repository is the planning and collaboration workspace for the CANVS
  product vision (2026-2030). It contains strategic documents, design specs,
  and coordination files for building the spatial social layer.

# CORE CONCEPTS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
key_concepts:
  spatial_browser: >
    Three modes in one: AR Mode (see anchored content), Map Mode (spatial radar),
    Time Mode (scrub through what happened here over time).

  spatial_primitives:
    - Pins: Simple anchors (notes, photos, audio, tips)
    - Bubbles: Group memory objects shared at a place
    - Time Capsules: Rich multimedia moments frozen in location
    - Trails: Narrative routes connecting multiple anchors
    - Drops: Geo-fenced releases that unlock at location+time
    - Portals: Places linked to other places via story logic

  reality_filter: >
    LLM agents that personalize and filter spatial content based on your taste,
    friends, values, and intent - turning raw data into felt relevance.

  glass_native: >
    Designed for AR glasses and spatial computing as the primary interface,
    with phones as the bootstrapping device.
