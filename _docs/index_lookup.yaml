# This document explains the _indices/ folder indexing system.
# Read this to understand how to create, update, and use index files.
# =============================================================================

# WHAT IS THE INDEX SYSTEM?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
purpose: >
  The _indices/ folder works like a book's index - a quick reference catalog
  that lets you find content without scanning every folder. When a new file
  is created anywhere in the project, an index entry should be added here.

why_it_exists: >
  Instead of traversing directories and reading multiple files, check the
  index first. This reduces token usage for LLMs and saves time for humans.

# INDEX ORGANIZATION (Two-Tier System)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
organization:
  master_index:
    file: _indices/master.yaml
    purpose: High-level overview of all project content
    contains: One entry per folder or major content area
    use_when: You need a quick project overview or don't know where to look

  folder_indices:
    pattern: _indices/<folder>_index.yaml
    examples:
      - _indices/planning_index.yaml
      - _indices/docs_index.yaml
      - _indices/vision_index.yaml
    purpose: Detailed entries for all files within a specific folder
    use_when: You know which area you need and want specific file details

# INDEX ENTRY FORMAT
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
entry_format:
  required_fields:
    path: Relative path from project root (e.g., planning/01_problem_statement)
    summary: One-line description of what the file contains
    keywords: List of search terms for discovery

  optional_fields:
    type: File type (document, code, config, template, data)
    updated: Last modification date (YYYY-MM-DD)
    related: Paths to related files

  example:
    path: planning/01_problem_statement
    summary: Defines the core problem the product solves
    keywords: [problem, market-gap, pain-points, opportunity]
    type: document

# CREATING INDEX ENTRIES
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
when_to_create:
  - rule: When a new file is created, add it to the appropriate folder index
  - rule: When a new folder is created, add it to master.yaml
  - rule: When file content significantly changes, update the summary/keywords

how_to_create:
  step_1: Identify which folder the file belongs to
  step_2: Open _indices/<folder>_index.yaml (create if doesn't exist)
  step_3: Add entry with path, summary, and keywords
  step_4: If new folder, also add entry to _indices/master.yaml

maintenance_rules:
  - Keep summaries under 100 characters
  - Use 3-6 keywords per entry
  - Update indices when files are moved or deleted
  - Review indices periodically for accuracy

# FOR LLM AGENTS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
llm_usage:
  navigation_flow:
    1: Read _indices/master.yaml for project overview
    2: Identify relevant folder from master index
    3: Read _indices/<folder>_index.yaml for detailed file list
    4: Use keywords to find specific files
    5: Read actual files only when needed

  best_practices:
    - Check indices before exploring folders directly
    - Use keyword search to narrow down results
    - Trust the summaries for quick decisions
    - Only read full files when details are needed

  token_efficiency: >
    Reading a 50-line index file is much cheaper than scanning 20 folders
    with 100+ files. Always start with indices.
