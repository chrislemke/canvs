# WHAT ARE META FILES?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
definition: >
  A _meta.yaml file is a quick-reference manifest placed in a folder that
  describes the folder's contents, purpose, and how to work with it.

location: >
  Look for _meta.yaml at the root of any folder. If present, read it FIRST
  before exploring other files in that folder.

# WHY DO THEY EXIST?
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
problem_solved: >
  Instead of scanning every file to understand a folder, read _meta.yaml
  to instantly know: what's here, what's important, and where to go next.

benefit_for_llms: >
  Reduces token usage and speeds up navigation. One small file tells you
  everything about a folder without reading its entire contents.
