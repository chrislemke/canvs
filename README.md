## Executive Summary

CANVS is a **persistent, AR-native social layer anchored to physical places**. Instead of consuming life through a decontextualized feed, people experience content where it belongs: at the location it refers to, at the scale it happened, with the atmosphere that gave it meaning.

We are building the infrastructure that turns the planet into an addressable surface. Every bench, alley, beach, mural, café table, trailhead, and plaza becomes a node in a living network of memories, knowledge, art, and coordination. A first kiss. A perfect skate trick. A protest that changed someone's life. A conversation that flipped a career. These moments no longer have to end and become invisible. With CANVS, **the place remembers**.

This is now feasible because the enabling stack has matured. World-scale AR anchoring is real and productized. Visual Positioning Systems combine GPS with vision-based localization to place content far more reliably than GPS alone. Persistent, shareable AR at real-world locations is shipping. Spatial computing hardware is moving from demo to platform. CANVS is designed to become **glass-native**: as AR glasses transition into everyday devices, CANVS becomes an always-available layer—less like an app, more like a new default interface for place.

---

## The Vision: The Internet of Places

We are building the **Internet of Places**.

Today's social platforms are optimized for infinite scrolling, not for human life. They isolate us inside algorithmic loops and replace lived reality with mediated content. CANVS flips the direction of attention.

### Core Principles

**The feed is not the home screen. The world is.**

Content is not something you "go find." It is something you **encounter**, because you are there. Meaning is not manufactured by engagement hacks. Meaning is **in context**.

A story about a sunset is powerful anywhere. A story about a sunset becomes *inevitable* when you are sitting in the exact place it happened, at the same angle, the same horizon line, the same wind.

### The Manifesto

When the world becomes a canvas, CANVS provides the paint.

We reject the premise that human connection must be mediated by rectangles and timelines. We believe that the most meaningful content is not viral content, but contextual content. We believe that presence matters, that geography is not friction but foundation, and that the next great interface is not a screen but the physical world itself.

**CANVS is the social operating layer for spatial computing.**

---

## The Problem We Solve

**Things happen at places. But digital memory is usually detached from the physical world.**

A first kiss. A perfect skate trick. A protest that changed someone's life. A conversation that flipped a career. A hidden café that felt like finding oxygen. Then the moment ends, and the meaning becomes invisible.

### The Status Quo

Someone stands at that place two weeks later and sees... concrete. The emotion is gone. The story exists somewhere in a cloud account, if at all. It is not "there." It is nowhere.

### The Gap

We walk through a world full of invisible meaning, unable to perceive the human layers that already exist all around us. Every street corner holds stories we cannot access. Every park bench has witnessed moments we will never know. The physical world is rich with significance, but our digital tools have disconnected us from it rather than revealing it.

### The Opportunity

CANVS makes the invisible visible. We create a layer where moments become spatially persistent. Place becomes the index. The world becomes browsable. And no memory is lost, because the place remembers.

---

## Core Features

### The Spatial Browser

CANVS reimagines how we interact with place through three seamlessly integrated viewing modes, unified under a single mental model: **space is memory, and memory has dimension**.

#### 🔮 AR Mode — "Magic Window / Glass View"

Point your device at the world and see what others have left behind. AR Mode transforms your screen into a lens that reveals the invisible layer of human experience anchored to physical space.

- **Immediate discovery** — Content appears as floating markers, glowing softly at their anchored locations
- **Proximity activation** — Walk closer to reveal richer detail; some content only materializes within arm's reach
- **Layered depth** — Toggle between public, friends-only, and community layers
- **Temporal hints** — Older memories fade slightly; recent drops pulse with fresh energy

*Perfect for: exploring new neighborhoods, rediscovering familiar places, stumbling upon hidden stories*

#### 🗺️ Map Mode — "Spatial Radar"

Pull back from street-level immersion to see the broader landscape of spatial content. Map Mode reveals patterns, clusters, and pathways that would otherwise remain invisible.

- **Heat mapping** — See where memory density concentrates
- **Layer filtering** — Surface only what matters: friends' drops, community pins, thematic collections
- **Trail visualization** — Follow narrative paths laid down by others
- **Hotspot discovery** — Identify places where stories converge

*Perfect for: planning explorations, finding community activity, understanding place-based patterns*

#### ⏳ Time Mode — "Temporal Scrub"

Slide through time to witness how a place has accumulated meaning. Time Mode adds the fourth dimension, revealing not just what exists here, but what happened here.

- **Timeline scrubber** — Drag through months and years to watch content appear and fade
- **Event clustering** — See how moments concentrate around dates
- **Change detection** — Witness how places transform through the memories anchored to them
- **Future glimpses** — Preview scheduled drops and time capsules set to unlock

*Perfect for: understanding place history, anticipating community events, witnessing transformation*

---

### Spatial Primitives

Every piece of content in CANVS is built from six fundamental primitives—simple building blocks that combine to create rich, layered experiences.

#### 📍 Pins

The simplest anchor. A single piece of content fixed to a precise location.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Note** | Text observation or memory | *"Best view of the bridge at golden hour"* |
| **Photo** | Image with location context | A snapshot of your grandmother's garden |
| **Audio** | Sound anchored to place | Street musician's melody, ambient recording |
| **Tip** | Insider knowledge | *"Ask for the secret menu—say 'friends of Marco'"* |

Pins are ephemeral by default (7 days) unless explicitly preserved. They're meant to be light, spontaneous, low-commitment.

---

#### 💭 Bubbles

Group memory containers that hold shared experiences. Bubbles are collaborative spaces anchored to meaningful locations.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  💭 BUBBLE: "Friday Night Crew"     │
│  📍 Corner of 5th & Main            │
│  👥 12 contributors                 │
│  📅 Active since 2019               │
│                                     │
│  "We used to meet here every        │
│   Friday before the bar closed..."  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Shared ownership** — Multiple people can add memories to the same bubble
- **Living archives** — Bubbles grow over time as contributors add new content
- **Emotional anchoring** — Perfect for places that hold collective significance

---

#### 🕰️ Time Capsules

Rich multimedia packages sealed until a specific moment. Time capsules combine multiple content types with intentional delay.

**Components:**
- 📸 Photos and videos
- 🎙️ Audio recordings and voice notes
- 📝 Written letters and reflections
- 🎨 3D spatial captures (room scans, object models)
- 📅 Unlock conditions (date, location, recipient presence)

**Unlock Modes:**

| Mode | Trigger | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Date-locked** | Specific calendar date | Opens on your 30th birthday |
| **Location-locked** | Must be physically present | Opens only at this exact spot |
| **Recipient-locked** | Specific person must open | Only your daughter can unlock |
| **Condition-locked** | Multiple criteria combined | Opens at sunset, one year from now, when you're here |

---

#### 🚶 Trails

Sequences of connected points forming narrative pathways. Trails transform walking into storytelling.

```
START ──●──────●──────●──────●──────●── END
        │      │      │      │      │
      Stop 1  Stop 2  Stop 3  Stop 4  Stop 5
```

**Trail Types:**
- **🎨 Art walks** — Street art tours with artist commentary
- **🍜 Food journeys** — Tasting routes through neighborhoods
- **💔 Grief walks** — Memorial paths for processing loss
- **📚 Story routes** — Fiction overlaid on real geography
- **🏃 Challenge paths** — Gamified urban exploration

---

#### 📦 Drops

Geo-fenced releases that only unlock when location and time conditions align. Drops create urgency and presence.

| Type | Behavior | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Flash drop** | 30-minute window | Limited merch unlock at pop-up location |
| **Dawn drop** | Sunrise activation | Meditation content at scenic overlook |
| **Crowd drop** | Requires N people | Group art reveal when 50 people gather |
| **Chase drop** | Moving target | Content that relocates hourly |

---

#### 🌀 Portals

Places linked to other places through story logic. Portals create non-geographic connections based on meaning.

**Connection Types:**
- **Memory links** — Places connected by personal history
- **Thematic links** — Places sharing common meaning (all "first kiss" locations)
- **Community links** — Places connected by shared community significance
- **Story links** — Fictional connections creating narrative geography

---

## Use Cases

CANVS serves three fundamental layers of human spatial experience.

### 💜 Emotional Layer

*Where feeling meets place. Personal meaning anchored to physical space.*

**🛹 Skating Bubble** — A legendary skate spot holds decades of community memory. Old-timers drop video clips from the 90s. New skaters add their first kickflip attempts. The spot's history becomes visible.

**🌅 Sunset Stories** — A group of friends pins a sunset spot on a rooftop. Each visit, someone adds: a photo, a voice note, a written reflection. Over years, the bubble fills with golden hour moments.

**🕯️ Grief & Remembrance** — After loss, a daughter creates a trail connecting places her mother loved. Walking the path becomes ritual. Friends add their own memories. The trail grows into collective memorial.

**💌 Letters to Future Me** — A graduate seals a time capsule at her college library. Inside: a letter to her 30-year-old self. The capsule waits, patient, until the day she returns to unlock it.

---

### 🔧 Utility Layer

*Practical intelligence anchored to place. Crowdsourced local knowledge.*

**🏄 Surf Intelligence** — A network of surf breaks, each pinned with real-time conditions, tide data, local tips. Regulars share wave knowledge invisible to casual visitors.

**🍜 Hidden Menu Layer** — The city's secret menus, revealed. Pins at restaurants unlock insider knowledge. A network of trusted tips, verified by community.

**♿ Accessibility Notes** — Wheelchair users and mobility-impaired contributors map the real accessibility landscape. Official data fails; community knowledge succeeds.

---

### 🎨 Creative Layer

*Art, play, and collective action anchored to space.*

**🖼️ Street Art Living Threads** — Every mural becomes a living document. Artists claim their work with origin stories. Community adds sightings as pieces evolve or fade.

**⚡ Flashmob Countdowns** — A drop appears downtown. People gather as the timer counts down. The drop unlocks—and the city transforms.

**🏛️ Civic Layer** — Community organizers create trails through neighborhood history. Walking becomes education. Place becomes politics.

---

## Technology Foundation

### Why Now? — The Enabling Stack

The convergence of five independent technology trajectories has created a window where CANVS becomes not just possible, but inevitable.

**World-Scale AR Anchoring Is Real and Productized**

| Platform | Coverage | Accuracy | Status |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Google ARCore Geospatial API | 100+ countries | Sub-meter | Production |
| Niantic Lightship VPS | 10M+ locations | Centimeter-scale | Production |
| Apple ARKit 6 Location Anchors | Major metros | Sub-meter | Production |
| Microsoft Azure Spatial Anchors | Cloud-persistent | Centimeter-scale | Production |

**Persistent, Shareable AR Is Shipping**

AR content created by one user can now be discovered and experienced by another user at the same physical location, days or months later. This breaks the fundamental isolation that made previous AR social products impossible.

**Consumers Are Being Trained**

Pokémon GO has trained 150M+ monthly active users to expect meaningful digital content at physical locations. Snapchat normalized AR overlays. TikTok trained a generation to expect cameras that understand reality.

**Hardware: Demo to Platform**

Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses proved consumers will wear camera-enabled eyewear. Apple Vision Pro proved high-fidelity spatial computing is ready for consumers. The convergence—affordable, all-day wearable AR glasses—is now a matter of manufacturing scale.

#### 3D Capture as Native Media

**Spatial Clips** — Short volumetric recordings (3-30 seconds) that capture a moment in three dimensions. Users can walk around the captured memory, viewing it from angles the original recorder never saw.

**Walkable Memory Fragments** — Longer-form spatial recordings that allow users to physically walk through a captured space, experiencing it as it existed at a previous moment in time.

---

### AI Reality Filter

The AI layer in CANVS is not a conversational assistant. It is a **reality filter**: a system that stands between the raw stream of spatially-anchored content and the user's conscious attention.

```

```

**Agent Jobs:**
1. **Summarize Layers** — Compress information to human-parseable summaries
2. **Surface What Matters** — Proactive relevance detection beyond keyword matching
3. **Prevent Overwhelm** — Active content suppression in high-density environments
4. **Prevent Harm** — Safety layer operating before content reaches perception

**Distinctive Features:**
- **Friend-Memory Surfacing** — "Remember when you and Sarah talked about this place? She left you a note."
- **Emotion Search** — "Show me joyful moments from this park"
- **Context Compression** — 156 memories compressed into navigable summaries
- **Path Generation** — Routes optimized for experience, not just distance

---

### Hardware Agnosticism

**Glass-Native Design Principles:**
1. **Glanceable** — Core information parseable in <500ms
2. **Ambient** — Background presence that doesn't demand focus
3. **Gesture-minimal** — Interactions possible with subtle movements
4. **Audio-first** — Voice and spatial audio as primary modalities
5. **Context-continuous** — Seamless transitions as attention shifts

**Phone as Bootstrap:** The CANVS phone app is architected as a companion to glasses, not as the primary experience. Full functionality during the transition period, with seamless handoff when glasses are available.

---

## Design Philosophy: Digital Humanism

CANVS represents a deliberate departure from the prevailing aesthetic language of technology. We reject the cold blues, dark modes, and neon glows. Instead, we embrace the warmth and imperfection of human expression.

### The Anti-Tech Aesthetic

Our visual identity draws inspiration from the **high-end sketchbook**—the kind carried by field researchers, architects, and artists. Imagine a well-loved Moleskine journal overlaid onto the physical world.

> *"Technology should feel like a trusted companion, not a clinical interface."*

### Visual Language Principles

**Organic Imperfection** — Every illustration employs a "scribble" quality—lines that waver slightly, edges that breathe, forms that suggest rather than define.

**Tactile Warmth** — Surfaces feel like high-quality cardstock. Shadows behave like pencil shading. The experience evokes handling a beloved book.

**Academic Restraint** — Typography and layout draw from scholarly publishing—generous margins, thoughtful hierarchy, purposeful white space.

### Color Palette: "The Field Journal"

| Role | Name | Hex | Application |
|------|------|-----|-------------|
| **Canvas** | Alabaster Paper | `#F0EFEA` | Primary background—mimics high-quality unbleached cardstock |
| **Ink** | Carbon | `#1A1A18` | Primary text—the density of dried india ink |
| **Accent 1** | Terracotta | `#D97757` | Human elements—emotion, connection, warmth |
| **Accent 2** | Sage Sketch | `#8DA399` | Place and nature—environmental context |
| **Highlight** | Highlighter Yellow | `#EEDC5B` | Active states—current location, selections |

### The Logo: "The Weaver's Knot"

A single continuous line forming a stylized knot doubling as a location pin. Drawn, not designed—with edges that waver organically.

- **The Knot** — Interconnection of stories, places, and people
- **The Pin** — Every story has a *where*
- **The Continuous Line** — Unbroken thread connecting past to future
- **The Imperfection** — We celebrate messy reality over false precision

---

## Trust, Safety & Governance

Location data is among the most sensitive information a person can share. CANVS approaches this responsibility with the gravity it demands.

### The CANVS Principle

> *"Precision is a privilege, not a default."*

Every feature, every default setting, every architectural decision begins from the assumption that location should be protected.

### Anti-Stalking Posture (Non-Negotiable)

- **Private-by-Default Creation** — Content visible only to creator until explicitly shared
- **Audience Controls** — Granular control: specific individuals, trusted circles, proximity-based
- **Proximity-Based Visibility** — Content discovery requires physical presence
- **Strong Reporting & Rapid Takedown** — Immediate review with presumption for reporter
- **Location Obfuscation** — Option to blur precise location to neighborhood level

### Spatially-Aware Moderation

| Location Type | Default Visibility | Discovery Mode |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Public landmark | Open | Active |
| Restaurant/venue | Open | Active |
| Residential area | Restricted | Friends-only |
| Healthcare facility | Highly restricted | Disabled |
| School/childcare | Highly restricted | Disabled |
| Private residence | Owner-controlled | Invite-only |

---

**Success:** External developers create more place-apps than internal team.

### 2030: The Spatial Social OS

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    THE SPATIAL SOCIAL OS                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Places become:                                                 │
│    • Queryable ("What happened here?")                          │
│    • Navigable ("Show me the creative district")                │
│    • Emotionally Legible ("How do people feel about this?")     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  The feed is obsolete as the primary social interface.          │
│  Presence replaces scrolling. Context replaces algorithms.      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Success:** "Check CANVS" becomes as natural as "Google it."

## The Big Opportunity

### The Evolution of Social Internet

| Era | Interface | Discovery | Limitation |
|-----|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Web Pages** (1995-2005) | Directories, links | Search engines | Static, isolated |
| **Feeds** (2006-2015) | Infinite scroll | Social graph, viral | Attention extraction |
| **Messaging** (2016-2024) | Chat, stories | Group forwarding | Fragmented silos |
| **Spatial** (2025+) | World-anchored | Physical location | **CANVS defines this** |

### CANVS Market Position

| Domain | CANVS Becomes |
|--------|---------------|
| **City Discovery** | Default discovery interface for cities |
| **Personal Memory** | Default memory interface for life |
| **Community Coordination** | Default coordination layer for communities |
| **Creator Expression** | Default canvas for spatial creators |
| **AR Infrastructure** | Default AR layer for glasses |

---

## Monetization Philosophy

### Core Principles

```
NON-INTRUSIVE     │  Enhances rather than interrupts
SPATIAL-NATIVE    │  Respects physical logic and place
OPT-IN            │  User chooses engagement level
VALUE-ALIGNED     │  Revenue from genuine utility
```

### Revenue Streams

1. **Spatial-Native Brand Objects** — Not pop-ups. Objects with physical logic: discoverable, interactive, contextually relevant.

2. **Local Business Toolkit** ("Digital Footfall Engine") — Claim presence, create welcome experiences, spatial campaigns, analytics.

3. **Events as High-Intensity Loops** — Spatial ticketing, exclusive content, memory capsules.

4. **Premium Features** — Vaults, high-fidelity capsules, private spaces, advanced AI, creator tools.

### What We Will Never Do

- Sell location data to third parties
- Show ads that cannot be dismissed
- Require payment to access personal memories
- Monetize private spatial content
- Create artificial scarcity of basic features

---

## Societal Impact

### Movement and "Touching Grass"

CANVS creates content that **requires presence**. You cannot consume the world from your couch. Discovery demands movement—walking, exploring, arriving.

Where other platforms optimize for time-on-screen, we optimize for **time-in-world**.

### Economic Revitalization

CANVS functions as a **discovery layer for local economies**—the family restaurant, the neighborhood bookshop, the three-generation barbershop. These businesses cannot compete in algorithmic attention markets. But they can become part of the living memory of their places.

### Strategic Data Asset

The experiential mapping CANVS enables has implications beyond consumer applications:
- **Urban Planning** — Human-centered city design
- **Cultural Preservation** — Community memory infrastructure
- **Emergency Response** — Real usage patterns for planning
- **National Sovereignty** — Platform-independent spatial data
