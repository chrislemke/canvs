This file should contain a description about how the project is explained in `product_vision_paper.md` It uses the power of data to drive its business. We know that data is the future and that without data no business will work as expected. This file should explain:
- what we can do with data
- how we can collect it
- how we can process it
- how data can help us improve this project and products concerning this project. It should explain why certain technologies of databases have advantages over others. For example, how could a graph database help us here to analyze data? How can we monetize and use data as an absolute base layer of product and business operations? So make extensive research. Go into details about every part of this topic. Think carefully and provide a good overview of what I was talking about. Read the product vision paper carefully. You can also go through the rest of the Project to get more ideas on what it's about and create a great outcome.
