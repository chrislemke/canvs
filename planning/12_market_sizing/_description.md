# Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)

## Overview

A Market Sizing document quantifies the revenue opportunity for a product by analyzing the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM). This analysis helps stakeholders understand the scale of the opportunity, informs business planning, and is essential for investor presentations. It combines top-down industry data with bottom-up customer analysis to create a credible, defensible market estimate.

## Purpose

- **Quantify opportunity**: Put a number on the market potential
- **Inform strategy**: Guide decisions about target markets and investment
- **Attract investment**: Demonstrate opportunity size to investors
- **Set goals**: Establish realistic market share and revenue targets
- **Validate focus**: Ensure the market is large enough to pursue
- **Guide prioritization**: Compare opportunities across segments
- **Support planning**: Input for financial projections and resource allocation

## When to Create

- **Business Planning**: During initial business case development
- **Fundraising**: For investor presentations and pitch decks
- **Market Entry**: When evaluating new markets or segments
- **Strategic Planning**: During annual planning and strategy reviews
- **New Product Launch**: When sizing opportunity for new offerings
- **Pivot Decisions**: When considering market focus changes

## Who's Involved

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Product Manager | Leads analysis, combines market data with product knowledge |
| Finance | Validates assumptions, models projections |
| Market Research | Provides industry data and analysis |
| Sales | Contributes customer and deal intelligence |
| Strategy | Aligns with company-level strategy |
| Executive Leadership | Reviews and approves assumptions |

## Key Components

### 1. TAM (Total Addressable Market)
The total revenue opportunity if you captured 100% of the market

**Calculation Methods**:
- **Top-Down**: Industry reports × average spend
- **Bottom-Up**: Number of potential customers × average revenue per customer
- **Value Theory**: Value delivered × willingness to pay

### 2. SAM (Serviceable Available Market)
The portion of TAM your product can realistically serve given business model, geography, and capabilities

**Considerations**:
- Geographic constraints
- Segment focus
- Business model limitations
- Product capabilities
- Go-to-market reach

### 3. SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
The realistic market share you can capture in the near-term (typically 1-3 years)

**Factors**:
- Current resources and team
- Sales capacity
- Competitive intensity
- Market awareness
- Go-to-market execution

### 4. MVM (Minimum Viable Market)
Optional: The smallest market that can sustain the business

### 5. Assumptions Log
All assumptions underlying the analysis with sources and confidence levels

### 6. Sensitivity Analysis
How estimates change based on different assumptions

## Calculation Approaches

### Top-Down
Start with total market data and narrow down:
```
Total industry revenue × % relevant to your segment × % reachable = SAM
```

### Bottom-Up
Start with individual customers and build up:
```
Number of potential customers × Average annual value × % you can reach = SAM
```

### Hybrid Approach
Combine both methods and reconcile:
- If within 15% of each other, assumptions are likely solid
- If widely divergent, investigate discrepancies

## Inputs & Dependencies

- Industry research reports (Gartner, Forrester, IBISWorld)
- Government statistics and census data
- Trade association data
- Competitor intelligence (funding, revenue, customers)
- Internal sales data and benchmarks
- Customer research and willingness-to-pay studies
- Economic and demographic trends
- Pricing analysis

## Outputs & Deliverables

- TAM/SAM/SOM calculations with methodology
- Visual market size representation (nested circles)
- Market growth projections
- Segment breakdown
- Assumptions documentation
- Sensitivity analysis
- Presentation-ready slides for stakeholders/investors
- Input for financial models

## Best Practices

1. **Use Multiple Methods**: Cross-validate with both top-down and bottom-up approaches.

2. **Document All Assumptions**: Make every assumption explicit with sources.

3. **Be Conservative on SOM**: Investors see through inflated capture estimates.

4. **Include Growth Rates**: Show where the market is heading, not just current size.

5. **Segment the Market**: Break down by geography, customer type, or use case.

6. **Show Your Work**: A defensible methodology matters as much as the numbers.

7. **Update Regularly**: Markets change—refresh estimates annually at minimum.

8. **Test Assumptions**: Where possible, validate assumptions with real data.

## Common Pitfalls

- **TAM Inflation**: Using the broadest possible market definition
- **Missing SAM Logic**: Not explaining why SAM is smaller than TAM
- **Unrealistic SOM**: Claiming you'll capture 10%+ of a mature market quickly
- **No Bottom-Up Validation**: Relying only on top-down industry reports
- **Hidden Assumptions**: Not making calculation methodology transparent
- **Static Analysis**: Not showing market growth trajectory
- **Ignoring Competition**: Not accounting for competitive dynamics in SOM
- **Precision Theater**: False precision (e.g., "$4.237B") without supporting evidence

## Investor Expectations

- **TAM**: Shows the size of the opportunity at scale
- **SAM**: Shows you understand your realistic addressable market
- **SOM**: Shows you have a realistic near-term plan
- **Growth Rate**: Shows market trajectory
- **5-Year Projection**: $10M+ in sales typically expected for VC-backed startups

### Rule of Thumb
- Target 10-25% market share within 5 years for planning
- Minimum $40M SAM typically required to attract institutional investment

### Market Sizing Table Example

| Metric | Value | Methodology | Sources |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| TAM | $50B | Global project management software market | Gartner 2024 |
| SAM | $8B | SMB segment (10-500 employees) in NA/EU | Filtered Gartner + Census data |
| SOM Year 1 | $4M | 50 customers × $80K ACV | Sales capacity model |
| SOM Year 3 | $40M | 500 customers × $80K ACV | Growth projection |
| Growth Rate | 12% CAGR | Market growth forecast | Forrester 2024 |

### Bottom-Up Calculation Example

```
Step 1: Total potential customers
- US companies with 10-500 employees: 650,000
- % that use project management tools: 45%
- Addressable customers: 292,500

Step 2: Revenue per customer
- Average seats per company: 25
- Price per seat per month: $15
- Annual revenue per customer: $4,500

Step 3: SAM calculation
292,500 × $4,500 = $1.32B

Step 4: SOM calculation (Year 3)
- Realistic penetration: 0.5%
- 292,500 × 0.5% = 1,462 customers
- 1,462 × $4,500 = $6.6M
