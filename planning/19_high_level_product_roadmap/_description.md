# High-Level Product Roadmap (Now / Next / Later)

## Overview

A High-Level Product Roadmap is a strategic document that communicates the planned direction and priorities for a product over time. The "Now/Next/Later" framework, popularized by Janna Bastow of ProdPad, organizes initiatives into broad time horizons without committing to specific dates. This approach provides flexibility for agile teams while still giving stakeholders visibility into strategic direction and priorities.

## Purpose

- **Communicate direction**: Share strategic priorities with stakeholders
- **Align teams**: Ensure everyone understands what's being worked on and why
- **Enable flexibility**: Adjust to change without breaking commitments
- **Prioritize work**: Force decisions about what matters most
- **Manage expectations**: Set realistic expectations without false precision
- **Guide planning**: Inform sprint and release planning

## When to Create

- **Product Strategy**: As part of strategic planning process
- **Team Kickoff**: When starting a new product or team
- **Quarterly Planning**: Updated during planning cycles
- **Stakeholder Communication**: For board meetings, all-hands, customer updates
- **Ongoing**: Maintained as a living document

## Who's Involved

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Product Manager | Owns and maintains the roadmap |
| Engineering Lead | Validates feasibility and sequencing |
| Design Lead | Ensures UX considerations are reflected |
| Stakeholders | Provide input and review priorities |
| Leadership | Approves strategic direction |
| Teams | Execute on roadmap initiatives |

## Key Components

### 1. Now (Current Focus)
- Items actively being worked on
- Usually 1-3 month horizon
- Highest confidence in scope and delivery
- Typically 2-5 initiatives

### 2. Next (Coming Soon)
- Highest-priority items after current work
- Usually 3-6 month horizon
- Lower confidence, more flexible scope
- Items ready to move to "Now" when capacity opens

### 3. Later (Future)
- Strategic direction and longer-term plans
- Usually 6+ month horizon
- Lowest confidence, subject to significant change
- Signals direction without commitment

### 4. (Optional) Trash/Won't Do
- Ideas explicitly deprioritized
- Helps with transparency about what's NOT happening
- Can be revisited if priorities change

### 5. For Each Item:
- Initiative name/title
- Brief description
- Strategic goal it supports
- Target persona or customer segment
- (Optional) Rough sizing/effort estimate

## Now/Next/Later vs. Timeline Roadmaps

| Aspect | Now/Next/Later | Timeline Roadmap |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Commitment | Low - priorities, not dates | High - specific dates |
| Flexibility | High - easy to adjust | Low - changes feel like failures |
| Accuracy | High - reflects reality | Often inaccurate |
| Stakeholder expectations | Realistic | Often leads to disappointment |
| Best for | Agile teams, early-stage products | Mature products, contractual obligations |

## Inputs & Dependencies

- Product vision and strategy
- Goals & Non-Goals
- Customer research and feedback
- Competitive analysis
- Technical roadmap and dependencies
- Resource constraints
- Business priorities and OKRs

## Outputs & Deliverables

- Visual roadmap (Miro, Aha!, Productboard, etc.)
- Roadmap document or presentation
- Regular updates for stakeholders
- Input for sprint planning
- Alignment with release planning

## Best Practices

1. **Keep It Living**: Update at least monthly. Stale roadmaps lose credibility.

2. **Stay High-Level**: Roadmaps show direction, not detailed requirements.

3. **Connect to Strategy**: Each item should link to strategic goals.

4. **Limit "Now" Items**: Only include what's actually being actively worked on.

5. **Be Honest About "Later"**: These are directional, not commitments.

6. **Make It Visible**: Share widely and reference regularly.

7. **Include the "Why"**: Context helps stakeholders understand priorities.

8. **Use Themes**: Group related initiatives into strategic themes.

9. **Review with Teams**: Ensure roadmap reflects what's actually feasible.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Date Creep**: Adding dates defeats the purpose of Now/Next/Later
- **Overcrowded "Now"**: Too many items in "Now" means no real priorities
- **Empty "Later"**: No "Later" items suggests lack of strategic thinking
- **Set and Forget**: Not updating as priorities and progress change
- **Too Detailed**: Including user stories instead of initiatives
- **No Context**: Items without strategic rationale
- **Disconnected**: Roadmap that doesn't reflect what teams are actually building
- **Feature-Only**: Missing improvements, tech debt, and other important work
