# Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) Summary

## Overview

The Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) framework is a theory of customer behavior that focuses on understanding the underlying "jobs" customers are trying to accomplish, rather than just their surface-level characteristics or feature requests. A JTBD Summary document captures the core jobs your target customers need to get done, providing a lens for product decisions that emphasizes outcomes over features. This approach, pioneered by Clayton Christensen, shifts focus from "what customers buy" to "why customers buy."

## Purpose

- **Understand true motivation**: Reveal the deeper reasons behind customer choices
- **Focus on outcomes**: Prioritize what customers want to achieve, not just features
- **Drive innovation**: Discover unmet needs that competitors miss
- **Improve positioning**: Communicate value in terms customers care about
- **Guide prioritization**: Help teams focus on the most important jobs
- **Reduce assumptions**: Ground decisions in validated customer needs
- **Enable empathy**: Build deeper understanding of customer context

## When to Create

- **Product Discovery**: At the start of new product development
- **Market Research**: When understanding a new market or segment
- **Feature Prioritization**: When deciding what to build next
- **Positioning Work**: When crafting messaging and value propositions
- **Competitive Analysis**: When understanding why customers switch
- **Post-Launch Analysis**: When understanding adoption and churn patterns

## Who's Involved

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Product Manager | Leads JTBD research and documentation |
| UX Research | Conducts customer interviews to uncover jobs |
| Design Team | Uses jobs to inform design solutions |
| Marketing | Translates jobs into messaging |
| Sales | Validates jobs through customer conversations |
| Customer Success | Provides insight on job completion success |

## Key Components

### 1. Job Statement
The core job expressed in a standard format:
> "When I [situation/context], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."

### 2. Job Context
- When does this job arise?
- What triggers the need?
- What circumstances surround it?

### 3. Functional Aspects
The practical, tangible outcomes customers want to achieve

### 4. Emotional Aspects
How customers want to feel during and after the job

### 5. Social Aspects
How customers want to be perceived by others

### 6. Current Solutions
What customers currently use to get the job done (including workarounds)

### 7. Struggles & Constraints
What makes the job difficult to complete successfully

### 8. Success Criteria
How customers judge whether the job was done well

## JTBD Hierarchy

### Main Job
The primary job the customer is trying to accomplish

### Related Jobs
Adjacent jobs that often accompany the main job

### Job Steps
The smaller tasks that make up the job process

### Consumption Chain Jobs
Jobs related to purchasing, learning, and using the solution

## Inputs & Dependencies

- Customer interviews (JTBD-specific interview protocol)
- Observation and ethnographic research
- Support tickets and customer complaints
- Win/loss analysis
- Switch interviews (why customers switched to/from competitors)
- Survey data on satisfaction and outcomes
- Analytics on user behavior

## Outputs & Deliverables

- Job statements for each identified job
- Job map showing job steps and stages
- Prioritized job list ranked by importance and satisfaction
- Opportunity scores for underserved jobs
- Input for user stories and feature specifications
- Foundation for value proposition development
- Customer journey context

## Best Practices

1. **Interview for Jobs, Not Features**: Ask about what customers are trying to accomplish, not what they want the product to do.

2. **Focus on the Job, Not the Person**: Jobs remain stable even as personas change.

3. **Include All Three Dimensions**: Capture functional, emotional, and social aspects.

4. **Understand the Full Context**: "When I [situation]" is as important as the outcome.

5. **Identify Workarounds**: Current solutions reveal job importance and unmet needs.

6. **Prioritize by Opportunity**: Use importance vs. satisfaction to find underserved jobs.

7. **Keep Jobs Solution-Agnostic**: Describe jobs without assuming any particular solution.

8. **Update Through Continuous Research**: Jobs should be validated and refined over time.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Feature-Centric Thinking**: Framing jobs as feature requests rather than outcomes
- **Surface-Level Jobs**: Stopping at what customers say instead of digging deeper
- **Ignoring Emotional Jobs**: Focusing only on functional outcomes
- **Solution Bias**: Describing jobs in terms of your product
- **Assuming You Know**: Not validating jobs with actual customer research
- **Too Granular**: Breaking jobs into steps so small they lose meaning
- **Too Abstract**: Making jobs so broad they don't guide decisions
- **Static Documentation**: Not updating as customer understanding deepens

## Tools & Templates

### Job Statement Template
> "When I [context/situation], I want to [motivation/action], so I can [desired outcome]."

### Opportunity Score
> Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction) = Opportunity Score

Jobs with high importance and low satisfaction represent the best opportunities.

### Example Job Statements

**Functional Job:**
> "When I'm preparing for a client presentation, I want to quickly find relevant data points, so I can make a compelling, evidence-based argument."

**Emotional Job:**
> "When I'm presenting to executives, I want to feel confident and prepared, so I can project credibility and competence."

**Social Job:**
> "When I share analysis with my team, I want to be seen as thorough and insightful, so I can build my reputation as a strategic thinker."

### Job Map Example

```
JOB: Prepare and deliver client presentation

STAGES:
1. Define → Determine what message to convey
2. Locate → Find supporting data and evidence
3. Prepare → Create slides and talking points
4. Verify → Ensure accuracy and completeness
5. Practice → Rehearse delivery
6. Present → Deliver to audience
7. Follow-up → Answer questions, share materials
```

### Classic JTBD Example (from Christensen)

> "People don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole."
>
> But actually: "They don't want a hole. They want to hang a picture. They don't want to hang a picture. They want to create a warm, personalized space. They don't want that—they want to feel at home."

The job exists at multiple levels. Understanding the right level is key.
