# Competitive Analysis (Feature + Positioning)

## Overview

A Competitive Analysis document systematically evaluates your competitors across multiple dimensions—including features, positioning, pricing, market share, and customer perception. Unlike a simple feature comparison, a comprehensive competitive analysis reveals how competitors position themselves, why customers choose them, and where opportunities exist for differentiation. It's a living intelligence document that informs product strategy, marketing, and sales.

## Purpose

- **Understand the landscape**: Know who you're competing against and how
- **Identify opportunities**: Find gaps and unmet needs competitors miss
- **Inform positioning**: Develop distinctive market positioning
- **Guide prioritization**: Focus development on differentiating capabilities
- **Enable sales**: Arm sales teams with competitive intelligence
- **Anticipate moves**: Predict competitor actions and market shifts
- **Validate strategy**: Ensure your approach makes sense given competition

## When to Create

- **Market Entry**: When entering a new market or launching a product
- **Strategic Planning**: During annual or quarterly planning cycles
- **New Competitor Entry**: When significant new competitors emerge
- **Sales Losses**: When losing deals to competitors
- **Positioning Work**: When developing or refreshing positioning
- **Ongoing Updates**: Maintained continuously as a living document

## Best Practices

1. **Continuous, Not One-Time**: Treat this as a living document, not a one-time project.

2. **Multi-Source Intelligence**: Gather from multiple sources—don't rely solely on websites.

3. **Include Indirect Competitors**: Don't ignore alternative approaches to the same problem.

4. **Focus on Customer Perception**: What matters is how customers see competitors, not just features.

5. **Analyze Positioning, Not Just Features**: Understand how competitors frame their value.

6. **Update Regularly**: Set a cadence for updates (monthly or quarterly).

7. **Make It Actionable**: Analysis should drive decisions, not just fill a document.

8. **Share Widely**: Ensure sales, marketing, and product all have access.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Feature-Only Focus**: Ignoring positioning, pricing, and go-to-market
- **Outdated Information**: Not keeping the analysis current
- **Confirmation Bias**: Only highlighting where you're better
- **Ignoring Indirect Competition**: Missing alternative solutions customers consider
- **Too Broad**: Trying to analyze every possible competitor
- **Too Shallow**: Listing competitors without meaningful analysis
- **No Action**: Creating analysis that doesn't inform decisions
- **Siloed**: Not sharing intelligence across teams
