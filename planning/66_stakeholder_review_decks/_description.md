# Stakeholder Review Decks

## Overview

Stakeholder Review Decks are presentation materials prepared for internal reviews and approvals at key project milestones. These presentations communicate project status, decisions, risks, and requests to executives, investors, cross-functional partners, or governance bodies. Effective review decks synthesize complex information into clear narratives that enable stakeholders to make informed decisions and maintain alignment on project direction.

## Purpose

- **Communicate progress**: Update stakeholders on project status
- **Secure approvals**: Get sign-off on key decisions
- **Align expectations**: Ensure shared understanding of goals
- **Surface risks**: Highlight issues requiring attention
- **Request resources**: Make case for additional support
- **Document decisions**: Create record of what was agreed
- **Build confidence**: Demonstrate competent project management

## When to Create

- **Phase Gates**: At major project milestones
- **Steering Committee**: Regular governance meetings
- **Executive Reviews**: Leadership check-ins
- **Board Meetings**: Investor/board updates

## Deck Design Principles

### Structure

- One idea per slide
- Clear hierarchy of information
- Logical flow

### Visual Design
- Consistent formatting
- Minimal text (6x6 rule)
- Data visualizations
- White space

### Content
- Audience-appropriate detail
- Facts and data, not opinions
- Clear recommendations
- Honest about challenges

## Inputs & Dependencies

- Project status data
- Metrics and KPIs
- Risk register
- Decision log
- Team input
- Previous review feedback
- Company templates/branding

## Outputs & Deliverables

- Review deck (slides)
- Speaking notes
- Pre-read summary (optional)
- Meeting recording
- Decision documentation
- Action item list
- Follow-up communications

## Best Practices

1. **Know Your Audience**: Tailor detail level to stakeholders.

2. **Lead with the Ask**: Make clear what you need from them.

3. **Tell a Story**: Create narrative arc, not just status bullets.

4. **Be Honest**: Surface problems early; don't hide bad news.

5. **Come with Recommendations**: Don't just present options.

6. **Prepare for Questions**: Anticipate pushback, have backup slides.

7. **Keep It Short**: Respect time; aim for discussion not monologue.

8. **Follow Up**: Document decisions and distribute promptly.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Information Dump**: Too much detail, no synthesis
- **Burying the Lead**: Key message on slide 15
- **No Clear Ask**: Stakeholders unsure what's needed
- **Data Without Insight**: Numbers without interpretation
- **Hiding Problems**: Not being transparent about issues
- **Last-Minute Prep**: Rushed, error-prone decks
- **Reading Slides**: Presenting without preparation
- **No Follow-Up**: Decisions not captured or shared
