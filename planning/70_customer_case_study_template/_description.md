## Best Practices

1. **Lead with Results**: Put the headline number front and center.

4. **Include Visuals**: Before/after charts, screenshots, photos.

5. **Make It Skimmable**: Snapshot box, bullets, clear sections.

6. **Multi-Format**: Create different versions for different uses.

8. **Get Proper Approval**: Both legal teams review before publishing.
