# Product Principles (Non-Negotiables)

## Overview

Product Principles are a set of guiding values and beliefs that help product teams make decisions about what to build and how to build it. They encode the team's philosophy about product development, serving as guardrails that ensure consistent decision-making regardless of the situation or personnel involved. Unlike tactical guidelines, principles are enduring beliefs that reflect what the team stands for and prioritizes.

## Purpose

- **Guide decision-making**: Provide a framework for making tough product choices
- **Ensure consistency**: Keep core values intact across different situations and team members
- **Scale teams**: Allow organizations to grow while maintaining product coherence
- **Resolve conflicts**: Help arbitrate between competing priorities or approaches
- **Communicate culture**: Express what the product team believes in and stands for
- **Repeat successes**: Encode behaviors that led to positive outcomes
- **Avoid past mistakes**: Prevent repeating behaviors that led to failures

## When to Create

- **Product Launch**: When establishing the foundation for a new product
- **Team Formation**: When building or restructuring product teams
- **Strategic Shifts**: When product direction or company values evolve
- **Growth Phases**: When scaling teams requires more explicit guidance
- **Post-Incident**: After learning from significant product decisions
- **Annual Reviews**: As part of regular strategic planning cycles

## Who's Involved

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Product Leadership | Primary authors, establish high-level principles |
| Product Managers | Contribute domain-specific principles, use daily |
| Design Team | May have complementary design principles |
| Engineering | May have complementary engineering principles |
| Executive Leadership | Ensure alignment with company values |
| Full Product Team | Collectively owns and upholds principles |

## Key Components

### 1. Principle Statement
A clear, memorable statement of the belief or value (e.g., "Simple beats powerful")

### 2. Rationale
Why this principle matters and what experience led to it

### 3. Guidance
How the principle applies to decision-making in practice

### 4. Examples
Concrete situations where the principle would be applied

### 5. Counter-Examples
What NOT following this principle looks like

### 6. Trade-offs
What this principle might mean sacrificing

## Types of Product Principles

### Top-Level Principles
Overarching beliefs that apply to everyone working on the product

### Domain Principles
Specific principles for different functions:
- **Design Principles**: Guide UX and visual decisions
- **Engineering Principles**: Guide technical decisions
- **Growth Principles**: Guide acquisition and retention decisions

### Strategic Principles
Principles tied to specific strategic goals:
- **Quality Principles**: Standards for reliability and performance
- **Innovation Principles**: Approach to experimentation and risk
- **Customer Principles**: Philosophy on customer relationships

## Inputs & Dependencies

- Company mission, vision, and values
- Past product decisions and their outcomes
- User research and customer insights
- Team culture and working style
- Industry best practices and patterns
- Competitive positioning strategy

## Outputs & Deliverables

- A set of 5-10 product principles (more dilutes impact)
- Documentation with rationale and examples
- Onboarding materials for new team members
- Decision-making framework tied to principles
- Regular review and update cadence

## Best Practices

1. **Keep the List Short**: Focus on 5-10 principles. Too many dilutes their power.

2. **Make Them Memorable**: Use concise, quotable language that sticks.

3. **Be Opinionated**: Principles should take a clear stance. "We value quality" is not a principle—everyone does.

4. **Include Trade-offs**: Great principles acknowledge what you're willing to sacrifice.

5. **Derive from Experience**: The best principles encode real learnings from successes and failures.

6. **Test with Decisions**: A useful principle should help resolve real product dilemmas.

7. **Update Thoughtfully**: Principles should be stable but can evolve as the product matures.

8. **Embed in Culture**: Reference principles regularly in discussions, reviews, and decisions.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too Generic**: Principles that any company would agree with aren't useful
- **Too Many**: Having 20+ principles makes them impossible to remember
- **Too Abstract**: Principles should guide concrete decisions
- **Never Updated**: Treating principles as permanent when context has changed
- **Ignored in Practice**: Having principles that aren't actually used
- **Top-Down Only**: Not involving the team in principle development
- **No Examples**: Leaving principles without practical application guidance
- **Conflicting Principles**: Having principles that contradict each other without clear priority

## Tools & Templates

- **Documentation**: Confluence, Notion, internal wikis
- **Collaboration**: Miro, FigJam for principle workshops
- **Communication**: Poster formats, team presentations
- **Decision Logs**: Track how principles are applied to actual decisions

## Examples & References

### Example Principle Format

> **Principle**: "Opinionated defaults, flexible overrides"
>
> **Rationale**: Users shouldn't have to configure everything, but power users need control.
>
> **Guidance**: Ship features with sensible defaults that work for 80% of users. Provide ways to customize for the 20% who need it, but don't require configuration upfront.
>
> **Example**: Auto-save is on by default, but users can switch to manual save in settings.
>
> **Trade-off**: We may occasionally frustrate users who want different defaults, but we prioritize the first-run experience for most users.

### Real-World Examples

**Intercom's Structure**:
- 4 top-level principles for how they build software
- 5 product design principles
- 5 engineering principles
- Everyone inherits top-level + their domain principles

**Common Principle Themes**:
- Simplicity over complexity
- User outcomes over features
- Data-informed over opinion-based
- Speed over perfection (or vice versa)
- Consistency over novelty
- Accessibility as a requirement, not a feature
