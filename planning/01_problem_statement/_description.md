# Problem Statement

## Overview

A Problem Statement is a foundational document that concisely defines the key user needs and obstacles to be addressed in product development. It articulates the core challenge or gap that a product aims to solve, serving as the anchor for all subsequent product decisions. Unlike a solution pitch, a problem statement focuses purely on understanding and framing the problem from the user's perspective.

## Purpose

- **Define the core challenge**: Clearly articulate what problem exists and why it matters
- **Align stakeholders**: Ensure everyone shares a common understanding of what needs to be solved
- **Guide development**: Provide direction for scoping, iteration, and feature prioritization
- **Enable evaluation**: Create a benchmark against which solutions can be measured
- **Prevent solution bias**: Keep teams focused on the problem before jumping to solutions

## When to Create

- **Discovery Phase**: At the very beginning of product development, before any solution ideation
- **New Feature Development**: When exploring additions to existing products
- **Pivot Considerations**: When reassessing product direction
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: When teams need to reset focus on user needs
- **Funding Pitches**: When articulating the market need to investors

## Who's Involved

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Product Manager | Primary author, synthesizes research into statement |
| UX Researcher | Provides user insights and validates problem framing |
| Stakeholders | Review and validate business relevance |
| Design Team | Uses statement to guide design exploration |
| Engineering | Reviews for technical context and feasibility considerations |
| Customers/Users | Source of problem insights through interviews and observation |

## Key Components

### 1. Problem Description
Outline what the problem appears to be without assuming any specific solutions. Focus on observable issues and user pain points.

### 2. Context
- **Root Causes**: What factors contribute to this problem?
- **Who is Affected**: Which user segments experience this problem?
- **When and How**: In what situations does this problem manifest?
- **Existing Solutions**: What alternatives exist and why are they insufficient?

### 3. Scope
- What your product will address
- What your product will NOT solve (equally important)
- Boundaries and constraints

### 4. Impact
- How the problem prevents users from achieving their goals
- Quantifiable effects where possible (time lost, money wasted, frustration levels)
- The potential positive impact of solving this problem

### 5. User Evidence
- Direct quotes from user research
- Data points supporting the problem's existence and severity
- Behavioral observations

## Inputs & Dependencies

- User research findings (interviews, surveys, observation)
- Customer support data and complaints
- Market research and competitive analysis
- Analytics data showing user struggles
- Stakeholder input on business context
- Jobs-to-be-Done research

## Outputs & Deliverables

- A clear, concise problem statement (typically 1-3 paragraphs)
- Supporting evidence documentation
- Problem scope boundaries
- Success criteria for evaluating solutions
- Input for PRDs, vision statements, and roadmaps

## Best Practices

1. **Stay User-Centered**: The focus should be on the user's problem—not your solution. Don't even think about your product yet.

2. **Keep It Concise**: A great problem statement can be understood quickly. Aim for clarity over comprehensiveness.

3. **Make It Specific**: Vague problems lead to vague solutions. Include specific user contexts and pain points.

4. **Include the "Why"**: Explain why this problem matters and why solving it creates value.

5. **Use the JTBD Framework**: The Jobs-to-be-Done framework can lead to more actionable and human-centered problem statements.

6. **Validate with Users**: Test your problem statement with actual users to ensure it resonates with their experience.

7. **Iterate Regularly**: Problem statements are not fixed—they evolve as products and markets change.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Solution Smuggling**: Embedding a preferred solution within the problem statement
- **Being Too Broad**: Trying to address every possible user pain point
- **Being Too Narrow**: Missing the underlying root cause by focusing on symptoms
- **Assumption-Based**: Writing based on internal opinions rather than user research
- **Ignoring Context**: Failing to explain when and where the problem occurs
- **Static Thinking**: Treating the problem statement as a one-time artifact rather than a living document

## Tools & Templates

- **Structured Templates**: "For [target user], who [situation], the problem is [problem] because [root cause], which results in [impact]"
- **Collaboration Tools**: Miro, FigJam, Confluence for collaborative problem framing
- **Research Repositories**: Dovetail, EnjoyHQ for organizing user evidence
- **Document Tools**: Notion, Google Docs, Confluence for the final statement

### Example Problem Statement Structure

> "Freelance designers spend an average of 5+ hours per week on administrative tasks like invoicing, contract management, and payment tracking. These tasks are spread across multiple disconnected tools, leading to missed payments, inconsistent branding, and significant mental overhead. Current solutions either require expensive subscriptions, lack design-focused features, or create more complexity than they solve. This administrative burden reduces time available for creative work and contributes to freelancer burnout."
