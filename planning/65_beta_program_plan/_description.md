# Beta Program Plan

## Overview

A Beta Program Plan outlines the strategy, structure, and execution of a beta testing phase before a product or feature's general availability. Beta testing involves releasing a near-complete product to a limited group of external users to gather real-world feedback, identify bugs, validate assumptions, and build early adoption. According to the International Software Testing Qualifications Board, companies that adopt beta testing have decreased post-launch defects by 60%, enhancing user satisfaction and retention.

## Purpose

- **Validate product**: Test with real users in real environments
- **Identify bugs**: Catch issues before broader release
- **Gather feedback**: Understand user needs and pain points
- **Build advocacy**: Create early champions and testimonials
- **Reduce risk**: Mitigate launch failures
- **Generate content**: Collect case studies and reviews
- **Test operations**: Validate support and infrastructure readiness

## When to Create

- **Feature Complete**: When core functionality is ready
- **Pre-Launch**: 4-12 weeks before planned GA
- **Major Updates**: Before significant version releases
- **New Markets**: When entering new segments
- **Platform Changes**: After major technical migrations
