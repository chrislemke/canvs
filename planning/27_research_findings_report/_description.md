# Research Findings Report

## Overview

A Research Findings Report documents the results, insights, and recommendations from a completed user research study. It synthesizes raw data into actionable insights, presents key findings with supporting evidence, and provides recommendations that inform product decisions. This report bridges research activities and product action, ensuring insights drive real change.

## Purpose

- **Communicate insights**: Share what was learned in an accessible format
- **Drive decisions**: Translate findings into actionable recommendations
- **Create organizational memory**: Document learnings for future reference
- **Build empathy**: Help teams understand users through evidence
- **Validate hypotheses**: Confirm or disprove assumptions
- **Prioritize work**: Inform roadmap and backlog decisions
- **Demonstrate value**: Show the impact of research investment

## When to Create

- **After Every Study**: Each research project should produce findings
- **Milestone Reporting**: At key project checkpoints
- **Quarterly Summaries**: Aggregate insights over time
- **Strategic Reviews**: For leadership decision-making
- **Continuous Discovery**: Ongoing insight documentation

## Finding Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Action |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| **Critical** | Prevents task completion, major blocker | Must fix before launch |
| **High** | Significant friction, many users affected | Address in current cycle |
| **Medium** | Noticeable issue, workarounds exist | Address soon |
| **Low** | Minor annoyance, nice-to-have fix | Backlog for later |
| **Opportunity** | Enhancement idea, not a problem | Consider for roadmap |

## Report Formats

### Detailed Report (Document)
- Comprehensive written findings
- Good for archival and reference
- Suitable for complex studies

### Presentation (Slides)
- Visual summary of findings
- Good for stakeholder meetings
- Focus on key insights

### One-Pager
- Executive summary format
- Quick read for leadership
- Highlights only critical findings

### Dashboard
- Living document updated regularly
- Good for ongoing research
- Tracks insights over time

## Inputs & Dependencies

- Research plan and objectives
- Session notes and recordings
- Survey responses
- Affinity diagram/analysis artifacts
- Quantitative data
- Previous research for context

## Outputs & Deliverables

- Written findings report
- Presentation deck
- Executive summary
- Video highlight reel (optional)
- Updated personas or journey maps
- Backlog items from recommendations
- Knowledge base updates

## Best Practices

1. **Lead with Insights, Not Data**: Findings should be interpreted, not just presented.

2. **Make Recommendations Specific**: "Improve navigation" is too vague; "Add breadcrumbs to product pages" is actionable.

3. **Include Evidence**: User quotes, video clips, and data build credibility.

4. **Prioritize Ruthlessly**: Not all findings are equally important.

5. **Tell a Story**: Connect findings into a coherent narrative.

6. **Consider Your Audience**: Tailor format and depth to readers.

7. **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Use visuals, quotes, and examples.

8. **Close the Loop**: Follow up on whether recommendations were implemented.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Data Dump**: Presenting raw data without interpretation
- **Burying the Lead**: Hiding key insights in lengthy reports
- **No Recommendations**: Findings without suggested actions
- **Overgeneralizing**: Drawing broad conclusions from small samples
- **Ignoring Context**: Not explaining study limitations
- **Report Fatigue**: Overly long reports that don't get read
- **Orphaned Reports**: Findings that never influence decisions
- **Missing Evidence**: Claims without supporting data

# User Research Findings: Checkout Flow Study

## Key Takeaways
1. **80% of users abandoned carts due to unexpected shipping costs**
   - Recommendation: Show shipping estimate on cart page
   - Priority: Critical

2. **Users struggled to find the guest checkout option**
   - Recommendation: Make guest checkout equally prominent as login
   - Priority: High

3. **Mobile users had difficulty entering payment info**

### Finding Structure

**Finding #1: Shipping Cost Surprise**

*What we observed:*
6 of 8 participants expressed frustration when shipping costs appeared only at the final checkout step.

*Evidence:*
> "Wait, $12 for shipping? I thought this was free. I need to reconsider this purchase." - P3

> "I would have appreciated knowing this before I filled out all my information." - P5

*Impact:*
80% of participants indicated they would abandon or reconsider their purchase

*Recommendation:*
Display estimated shipping cost on the product page or cart page before checkout begins

*Priority:* Critical
