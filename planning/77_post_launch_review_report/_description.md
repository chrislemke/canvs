# Post-Launch Review Report

## Overview

A Post-Launch Review Report is a comprehensive assessment document created after a product or feature launch to evaluate its success, capture learnings, and inform future decisions. Unlike incident postmortems (which focus on what went wrong), post-launch reviews holistically examine what went well, what could improve, customer reception, business impact, and recommendations for future launches. This structured retrospective analysis ensures that organizational learning is captured and applied to continuously improve the product development and launch process.

## Purpose

- **Measure success**: Evaluate launch against defined goals and KPIs
- **Capture learnings**: Document what worked and what didn't
- **Inform iteration**: Guide product improvements and optimizations
- **Improve process**: Enhance future launch processes
- **Celebrate wins**: Recognize team accomplishments
- **Align stakeholders**: Share outcomes with leadership and teams
- **Build knowledge**: Create institutional memory for future launches

## When to Create

- **Major Product Launches**: 4-8 weeks after launch
- **Significant Feature Releases**: 3-6 weeks after release
- **Campaign Launches**: After campaign conclusion
- **Beta Programs**: At end of beta period
- **Market Expansion**: After entering new markets
- **Quarterly Reviews**: As part of regular product review cycles

## Best Practices

1. **Plan the Review Early**: Schedule the retrospective before launch; get on calendars.

2. **Gather Data Systematically**: Collect quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback.

3. **Include All Stakeholders**: Get perspectives from every team involved.

4. **Be Honest**: Capture real challenges, not just wins.

5. **Focus on Actionable Insights**: Recommendations should be specific and implementable.

6. **Document "Start, Stop, Continue"**: Clear framework for improvement.

7. **Share Broadly**: Ensure learnings reach future launch teams.

8. **Follow Up on Recommendations**: Track implementation of improvements.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Victory Lap Only**: Only celebrating wins, not examining challenges
- **Blame Game**: Focusing on who caused problems rather than systemic issues
- **Data Gaps**: Not having the metrics needed to assess success
- **Delayed Review**: Waiting too long, losing memory of details
- **Limited Participation**: Only involving a few team members
- **No Action Items**: Findings that don't lead to improvements
- **Buried Documents**: Reports that no one reads or references
- **Cherry-Picking**: Selecting data that supports desired narrative

## The "Start, Stop, Continue" Framework

- Ideas that emerged during launch
- Capabilities we should add

### Stop Doing
What practices should we eliminate?

### Continue Doing
