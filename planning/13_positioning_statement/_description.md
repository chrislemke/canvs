# Positioning Statement

## Overview

A Positioning Statement is a concise description of your product and target audience that explains how it fills a specific market need and what makes it different from alternatives. Unlike customer-facing taglines, positioning statements are internal strategic documents that guide all marketing, sales, and product decisions. They ensure consistent messaging and help everyone understand exactly where the product fits in the competitive landscape.

## Purpose

- **Define market position**: Articulate where your product fits in the market
- **Guide messaging**: Provide foundation for all marketing communications
- **Ensure consistency**: Keep all teams aligned on how to describe the product
- **Differentiate**: Clarify what makes your product unique
- **Filter decisions**: Help evaluate whether initiatives support the positioning
- **Enable sales**: Give sales teams a clear way to articulate value

## When to Create

- **Product Launch**: Before going to market with a new product
- **Repositioning**: When changing how the product is perceived
- **Market Entry**: When entering new markets or segments
- **Competitive Response**: When market dynamics shift significantly
- **Brand Refresh**: As part of broader branding initiatives
- **Annual Planning**: Reviewed and updated during strategic planning

## Key Components

## Product vs. Brand Positioning

## Best Practices

1. **Keep It Short**: If it's longer than five sentences, you've gone too far. Aim for 1-2 sentences.

2. **Be Specific**: Vague positioning doesn't guide decisions. Include specific target, category, and differentiation.

3. **Test with Customers**: Validate that positioning resonates with actual target customers.

4. **Ground in Reality**: Positioning must reflect actual product capabilities, not aspirations.

5. **Differentiate Meaningfully**: Ensure differentiation is real and valued by customers.

6. **Align All Decisions**: Every marketing and product decision should support the positioning.

7. **Review Regularly**: Markets change—revisit positioning periodically.

8. **Separate from Taglines**: Positioning statements are internal; taglines are customer-facing.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too Broad**: Trying to position for everyone, differentiating from no one
- **Feature-Focused**: Listing features instead of communicating value
- **Undifferentiated**: Making claims any competitor could make
- **Aspirational Fiction**: Positioning on capabilities you don't have
- **Category Confusion**: Not being clear about what market you compete in
- **Changing Too Often**: Inconsistent positioning confuses the market
- **Ignoring Competition**: Not acknowledging competitive alternatives
- **Internal Jargon**: Using language customers don't understand
