# App Store Listing Copy

## Overview

App Store Listing Copy encompasses all the text content optimized for app store pages on Apple App Store and Google Play Store. This includes the app title, subtitle/short description, full description, keywords, and promotional text. Effective app store copy, combined with visual assets, drives discoverability and conversion through App Store Optimization (ASO). With 70% of App Store visitors using search to find new apps and 65% of downloads occurring right after a search, well-crafted listing copy is critical for app success.

## Purpose

- **Drive discoverability**: Rank higher in app store search
- **Increase conversions**: Turn visitors into downloads
- **Communicate value**: Explain what the app does
- **Differentiate**: Stand out from competitors
- **Set expectations**: Align user expectations with experience
- **Support marketing**: Consistent messaging with campaigns
- **Enable localization**: Prepare for global markets

## When to Create

- **App Launch**: Before initial submission
- **Major Updates**: When significant features ship
- **ASO Optimization**: During optimization cycles
- **Localization**: When entering new markets
- **Keyword Research**: When refreshing strategy
- **A/B Testing**: When testing variations

## Writing Guidelines

### App Title

- Keep concise and memorable

**Examples:**
- "Calm - Sleep & Meditation"
- "Duolingo: Language Lessons"
- "Notion - Notes, Tasks, Wikis"

### Subtitle/Short Description
- Lead with primary benefit
- Include key differentiator
- Action-oriented language

**Examples:**
- "Reduce stress & sleep better" (Calm)
- "Learn 40+ languages free" (Duolingo)

### Full Description
```
Structure:
1. Hook (first 1-3 lines visible without expand)
2. Key benefits (bullet points)
3. Features (detailed list)
4. Social proof (awards, press, ratings)
5. Call to action
```

## Platform Differences

### Apple App Store
- **Description NOT indexed**: Write for conversion
- **Don't repeat keywords**: No benefit to repetition across title, subtitle, keywords
- **Keywords field**: Comma-separated, no spaces, no duplicates

### Google Play Store
- **Description IS indexed**: Use keywords strategically
- **Keyword density matters**: Repeat key terms naturally 3-5 times
- **Short description important**: Most visible text after title

## ASO Best Practices

### Keyword Research
- Analyze competitor keywords
- Use ASO tools (App Radar, Sensor Tower)
- Balance volume and competition
- Include long-tail keywords

### Optimization
- A/B test title and visuals
- Localize for key markets
- Update regularly (every 4-8 weeks)
- Monitor ranking changes

### Conversion Optimization

- Use bullet points for scannability
- Include social proof (awards, reviews)
- Clear call to action

## Inputs & Dependencies

## Outputs & Deliverables

## Best Practices

1. **Lead with Value**: First 3 lines are most important.

3. **Don't Repeat (iOS)**: Keywords, title, subtitle all unique.

4. **Do Repeat (Google)**: Use key terms 3-5 times in description.

5. **Localize Properly**: Adapt, don't just translate.

6. **Use Formatting**: Bullets, emojis (sparingly), spacing.

7. **A/B Test**: Use store experiments to optimize.

8. **Update Regularly**: Keep content fresh and relevant.
