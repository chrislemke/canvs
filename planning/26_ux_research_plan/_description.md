# UX Research Plan

## Overview

A UX Research Plan is a strategic document that guides individual user research projects. It outlines the research objectives, methodology, participants, timeline, and logistics for a study. The plan ensures research is purposeful, well-organized, and aligned with product goals. It serves as a reference throughout the research process and helps communicate the approach to stakeholders.

## Purpose

- **Define objectives**: Clarify what you're trying to learn
- **Guide methodology**: Determine the right research approach
- **Align stakeholders**: Ensure agreement on research scope
- **Enable planning**: Organize logistics, recruiting, and timeline
- **Ensure rigor**: Maintain research quality and consistency
- **Document decisions**: Record methodological choices for reference
- **Communicate value**: Help others understand research activities

## When to Create

- **Before Every Study**: Each research project needs a plan
- **Discovery Phase**: When exploring a problem space
- **Design Validation**: When testing designs or prototypes
- **Post-Launch**: When evaluating launched features
- **Continuous Discovery**: For ongoing research programs

## Who's Involved

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| UX Researcher | Creates and owns the research plan |
| Product Manager | Defines research questions and priorities |
| Design Lead | Contributes questions about design decisions |
| Engineering | May have feasibility questions to explore |
| Stakeholders | Review and approve research objectives |

## Key Components

### 1. Background & Context
- Why is this research being conducted?
- What is the product/feature context?
- What do we already know?

### 2. Research Objectives
- What are we trying to learn?
- What decisions will this inform?
- Clear, specific goals for the study

### 3. Research Questions
- Specific questions to answer
- Prioritized by importance
- Answerable within study scope

### 4. Methodology
- Research method(s) selected
- Rationale for method choice
- Study design details

### 5. Participants
- Who will participate?
- Recruiting criteria
- Sample size and rationale
- Screener questions

### 6. Stimuli/Materials
- What will participants interact with?
- Prototypes, wireframes, tasks
- Discussion guides or survey instruments

### 7. Logistics & Timeline
- Study dates and duration
- Recruiting timeline
- Analysis and reporting schedule
- Session locations (remote/in-person)

### 8. Team & Roles
- Who is involved?
- Who observes vs. facilitates?
- Responsibilities assignment

### 9. Ethical Considerations
- Consent process
- Data handling and privacy
- Incentives for participants

### 10. Analysis Approach
- How will data be analyzed?
- Expected deliverables
- Reporting format

## Research Methods Overview

### Qualitative Methods
- **User Interviews**: Deep-dive conversations
- **Contextual Inquiry**: Observation in natural environment
- **Usability Testing**: Task-based product testing
- **Diary Studies**: Longitudinal experience capture
- **Focus Groups**: Group discussion (use sparingly)

### Quantitative Methods
- **Surveys**: Scaled feedback from many users
- **A/B Testing**: Comparative behavior testing
- **Analytics Analysis**: Usage data patterns
- **Card Sorting**: Information architecture validation
- **Tree Testing**: Navigation testing

### Generative vs. Evaluative

| Generative | Evaluative |
|------------|------------|
| "What should we build?" | "Does this work?" |
| Interviews, observation | Usability testing |
| Early in process | Later in process |
| Open-ended | Task-focused |

## Sample Size Guidelines

| Method | Typical Sample | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Usability Testing | 5-8 per round | Finds ~85% of issues |
| User Interviews | 8-12 | Until saturation |
| Surveys | 100-400+ | For statistical significance |
| Card Sorting | 15-30 | Depends on complexity |

## DECIDE Framework

1. **D**etermine the goals
2. **E**xplore the questions
3. **C**hoose evaluation methods
4. **I**dentify practical issues
5. **D**ecide on ethical issues
6. **E**valuate, analyze, interpret

## Inputs & Dependencies

- Product strategy and roadmap
- Existing research and insights
- Stakeholder questions
- Design artifacts (if evaluative)
- Recruiting resources
- Budget and timeline

## Outputs & Deliverables

- Research plan document
- Screener questionnaire
- Discussion guide or test script
- Consent forms
- Session recordings (if applicable)
- Research findings report
- Actionable recommendations

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Questions**: Research objectives should be specific and answerable.

2. **Choose Methods Wisely**: Match method to research question.

3. **Recruit the Right People**: Screening criteria must match your users.

4. **Plan for Analysis**: Know how you'll analyze before you collect.

5. **Build in Flexibility**: Plans may need to adapt during research.

6. **Pilot First**: Test your materials before the full study.

7. **Involve Stakeholders**: Get buy-in on objectives and methods.

8. **Document Everything**: Transparent methodology builds trust.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Vague Objectives**: Questions too broad to answer
- **Wrong Method**: Using surveys when interviews would work better
- **Wrong Participants**: Recruiting people who aren't actual users
- **Leading Questions**: Biasing participants toward desired answers
- **Too Ambitious**: Trying to answer too many questions in one study
- **Analysis Afterthought**: Not planning how to synthesize findings
- **No Stakeholder Buy-in**: Research that doesn't influence decisions
- **Ignoring Ethics**: Inadequate consent or data protection
