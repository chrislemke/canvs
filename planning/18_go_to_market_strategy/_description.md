# Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy

## Overview

A Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy is a comprehensive action plan that outlines how a company will bring a product or service to market and drive customer adoption. It covers target market definition, positioning, channels, sales and marketing tactics, pricing, and success metrics.

- **Reduce risk**: Identify and mitigate go-to-market risks
- **Measure success**: Establish clear metrics for launch performance

## When to Create
