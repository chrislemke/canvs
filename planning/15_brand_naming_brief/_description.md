# Brand / Naming Brief

## Overview

A Brand/Naming Brief is a strategic document that guides the development of a product or company name. It outlines objectives, requirements, and parameters for the naming process, ensuring the final name aligns with brand strategy, resonates with the target audience, and stands out in the competitive landscape. The brief forces alignment among stakeholders on what the name should convey, what types of names to consider, and what constraints apply.

## Purpose

- **Guide creative work**: Provide clear direction for name development
- **Define boundaries**: Establish what's in and out of bounds
- **Enable evaluation**: Create criteria for assessing name candidates
- **Prevent false starts**: Avoid wasted effort on names that won't work
- **Document decisions**: Record the strategic rationale behind naming choices
- **Support legal review**: Provide context for trademark research

## When to Create

- **New Product Launch**: When naming a new product or service
- **Company Formation**: When naming a new venture or startup
- **Rebranding**: When renaming an existing product or company
- **Product Line Extension**: When naming additions to existing lines
- **Feature Naming**: When significant features need branded names
- **Market Expansion**: When existing names don't translate to new markets

- **Coined**: Invented words (Kodak, Xerox)
- **Lexical**: Wordplay, puns (Netflix, YouTube)
- **Acronyms**: From longer names (IBM, UPS)
- **Compound**: Combined words (FedEx, Instagram)
- **Real Words**: Existing words recontextualized (Apple, Uber)

### 7. Name Tonality
The personality and feeling of the name:
- Professional vs. playful

## Best Practices

1. **Get Alignment Early**: The brief forces stakeholders to agree before generating names.

2. **Be Specific on Tonality**: "Modern and approachable" is better than "good."

3. **Include What to Avoid**: Naming what's off-limits is as important as what's desired.

4. **Consider International**: Check that names work across target markets.

5. **Check Availability Early**: Domain and trademark landscapes matter.

6. **Limit Decision Makers**: Too many opinions make naming impossible.

7. **Document Tradeoffs**: Name choices always involve tradeoffs—record them.

8. **Plan for Evolution**: Consider how the name will age and scale.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Vague Objectives**: Unclear briefs lead to misaligned name candidates
- **Too Many Constraints**: Making it impossible to find viable names
- **Skipping Competitive Review**: Ending up too similar to competitors
- **Ignoring Pronunciation**: Names that people can't say or spell
- **Premature Attachment**: Falling in love with names before legal clearance
- **Too Many Stakeholders**: Decision-by-committee rarely produces great names
- **Cultural Blindspots**: Names that don't translate or have negative associations
- **Neglecting Digital**: Not checking domain and social availability
