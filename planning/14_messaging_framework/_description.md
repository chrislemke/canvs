# Messaging Framework (Tagline, Key Messages, Proof Points)

## Overview

A Messaging Framework is a structured document that translates positioning strategy into a hierarchy of approved messages for use across all marketing and sales communications. It defines the core value proposition, key messaging pillars, supporting proof points, and the tone/style guidelines that ensure consistent, compelling communication. The framework serves as the single source of truth for how the organization talks about itself and its products.

## Purpose

- **Ensure consistency**: Keep all communications aligned across teams and channels
- **Enable scale**: Allow multiple people to create on-brand content
- **Guide content creation**: Provide building blocks for marketing materials
- **Build credibility**: Support claims with verified proof points
- **Target effectively**: Tailor messages to different audience segments
- **Save time**: Eliminate the need to reinvent messaging for each initiative
- **Train teams**: Onboard new team members on how to communicate

## When to Create

- **Post-Positioning**: After finalizing positioning statement
- **Pre-Launch**: Before major product or campaign launches
- **Rebranding**: During brand refresh or repositioning
- **New Market Entry**: When targeting new segments
- **Team Scaling**: When marketing/sales teams grow
- **Annual Review**: Updated regularly as product and market evolve

## Who's Involved

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Product Marketing | Primary author, owns the framework |
| Marketing | Uses framework for campaigns and content |
| Sales | Uses framework for customer conversations |
| Content Team | Creates assets using framework |
| Brand | Ensures alignment with brand guidelines |
| Product Manager | Validates product claims |
| Legal | Reviews claims for compliance |

## Key Components

### 1. Core Value Proposition / Tagline
The overarching statement that captures the primary value:
- A single, memorable statement
- Used as headline in key materials
- Answers "Why should I care?"

### 2. Positioning Statement
The strategic foundation (internal reference):
- Target audience
- Market category
- Key benefit and differentiation

### 3. Messaging Pillars (3-5)
The main themes or value drivers that support the positioning:
- Each pillar is a distinct area of value
- Should be mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive
- Typically 3-5 pillars for manageability

### 4. For Each Pillar:
**Headline**
- Snappy, tagline-like distillation

**Value Proposition**
- How this aspect solves a specific pain point

**Proof Points (3+ each)**
- Statistics and data
- Product features and benefits
- Customer success stories
- Awards or recognition
- Industry validation

### 5. Audience Variations
Message variations for different:
- Buyer personas
- User personas
- Industry verticals
- Use cases

### 6. Tone and Voice Guidelines
- Brand personality attributes
- Words to use / words to avoid
- Style guidelines

### 7. Boilerplate Copy
Approved standard descriptions:
- Company boilerplate (various lengths)
- Product boilerplate
- Leadership bios

## Messaging Hierarchy Example

```
CORE VALUE PROPOSITION
"[Tagline/Primary Headline]"
           │
    ┌──────┼──────┐
    ▼      ▼      ▼
PILLAR 1  PILLAR 2  PILLAR 3
    │         │         │
    ▼         ▼         ▼
• Headline   • Headline   • Headline
• Value Prop • Value Prop • Value Prop
• Proof 1    • Proof 1    • Proof 1
• Proof 2    • Proof 2    • Proof 2
• Proof 3    • Proof 3    • Proof 3
```

## Inputs & Dependencies

- Positioning Statement
- Value Proposition & Differentiators
- Target Customer Personas
- Competitive Analysis
- Customer research and testimonials
- Product capabilities and features
- Performance data and metrics
- Brand guidelines

## Outputs & Deliverables

- Messaging Framework document
- Pillar-specific messaging sheets
- Persona-specific message variants
- Approved proof points library
- Boilerplate copy at various lengths
- Tone and voice guidelines
- Content brief templates

## Best Practices

1. **Limit to 3-5 Pillars**: More pillars dilute focus and make the framework unwieldy.

2. **Make Proof Points Specific**: "80% faster" is better than "significantly faster."

3. **Keep It Living**: Update regularly as new proof points emerge.

4. **Test with Audiences**: Validate that messages resonate with target customers.

5. **Make It Accessible**: Store where everyone can find and reference it.

6. **Create Variants by Audience**: Different personas may care about different pillars.

7. **Include Examples**: Show how the framework translates to real content.

8. **Review Claims with Legal**: Ensure all proof points are defensible.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too Many Pillars**: Having 8+ pillars makes the framework unusable
- **Vague Proof Points**: Claims without specific evidence lack credibility
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Not tailoring for different audience segments
- **Set and Forget**: Not updating as product and market evolve
- **Inconsistent Usage**: Teams creating their own messages outside the framework
- **Missing Voice Guidelines**: Having messages but no guidance on tone
- **Feature-Heavy**: Listing features instead of communicating value
- **Unverified Claims**: Using proof points that can't be substantiated
