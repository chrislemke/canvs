# User Journey Maps / Service Blueprint

## Overview

User Journey Maps and Service Blueprints are visual documents that illustrate the complete experience a user has with a product or service over time. A User Journey Map focuses on the customer's perspective—their actions, thoughts, emotions, and pain points across touchpoints. A Service Blueprint extends this by adding the backstage processes, systems, and people that support each customer interaction. Together, they reveal opportunities to improve both user experience and operational efficiency.

## Purpose

- **Visualize the experience**: Create a shared view of the end-to-end user journey
- **Identify pain points**: Reveal friction and frustration in the current experience
- **Find opportunities**: Discover moments for improvement or innovation
- **Align teams**: Create shared understanding across departments
- **Drive empathy**: Help teams feel what users experience
- **Prioritize work**: Focus on high-impact touchpoints
- **Connect front and back stage**: Show how operations support customer experience

## When to Create

- **Discovery Phase**: To understand current user experience
- **New Product Design**: To plan the ideal future experience
- **Service Improvement**: When optimizing existing experiences
- **Omnichannel Design**: When coordinating across touchpoints
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: To build shared understanding
- **Onboarding Design**: When mapping the user's first experience

## Who's Involved

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| UX Researcher | Leads research to inform the map |
| UX Designer | Creates and maintains the visualization |
| Product Manager | Connects map to product priorities |
| Customer Success | Provides frontline insights |
| Operations | Documents backstage processes |

## Key Components

### User Journey Map Elements

**1. Persona**
The specific user whose journey is being mapped

**2. Scenario & Goals**
The context and what the user is trying to achieve

**3. Phases/Stages**
The major steps in the journey (e.g., Awareness → Consideration → Purchase → Use → Advocacy)

**4. Actions**
What the user does at each stage

**5. Touchpoints**
Where the user interacts with the product/service

**6. Thoughts**
What the user is thinking at each moment

**7. Emotions**
How the user feels (often shown as an emotional curve)

**8. Pain Points**
Frustrations and problems encountered

**9. Opportunities**
Ideas for improvement at each stage

### Service Blueprint Additional Elements

**10. Line of Interaction**
Boundary between customer actions and front-stage

**11. Front Stage**
Employee actions visible to customers

**12. Line of Visibility**
Boundary between what customers see and don't see

**13. Back Stage**
Employee actions hidden from customers

**14. Support Processes**
Systems and processes that enable service delivery

**15. Physical Evidence**
Tangible elements customers encounter

## Types of Journey Maps

| Type | Purpose | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Current State** | Document existing experience | Identifying problems |
| **Future State** | Design ideal experience | Planning improvements |
| **Day-in-the-Life** | Broader context of user's day | Understanding context |
| **Service Blueprint** | Include backstage operations | Service optimization |

## Inputs & Dependencies

- User research (interviews, observation)
- Analytics and behavioral data
- Customer feedback and support data
- Persona definitions
- Business process documentation
- Stakeholder interviews
- Competitive experience analysis

## Outputs & Deliverables

- Visual journey map (poster or digital)
- Service blueprint with all swim lanes
- Pain point inventory
- Opportunity backlog
- Prioritized improvement recommendations
- Presentation for stakeholders
- Living document for ongoing reference

## Best Practices

1. **Base on Real Research**: Maps based on assumptions miss real pain points.

2. **Focus on One Persona**: Don't try to map everyone's journey in one map.

3. **Include Emotions**: The emotional journey reveals true experience quality.

4. **Make It Collaborative**: Involve cross-functional teams in creation.

5. **Connect to Actions**: Maps should drive decisions, not just decorate walls.

6. **Keep It Living**: Update as you learn more about users.

7. **Consider All Channels**: Include digital, physical, and human touchpoints.

8. **Go Beyond Your Product**: Map the full experience, not just your app.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Assumption-Based**: Maps without research data
- **Too Detailed**: Overwhelming complexity that obscures insights
- **Too Abstract**: Missing specific, actionable details
- **Siloed Creation**: Made by one person without input
- **Never Updated**: Treating maps as one-time artifacts
- **No Emotions**: Focusing only on actions, missing feelings
- **Missing Backstage**: Not connecting to operational reality
- **Unused**: Creating maps that don't inform decisions
