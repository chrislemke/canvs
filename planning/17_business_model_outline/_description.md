# Business Model Outline

## Overview

A Business Model Outline documents how your company creates, delivers, and captures value. Using frameworks like the Business Model Canvas, it describes the key components of the business: who your customers are, what value you provide, how you reach them, how you make money, and what resources and activities are required. This document provides a holistic view of the business that ensures all elements work together coherently.

## Purpose

- **Clarify the business**: Articulate how the business works end-to-end
- **Align stakeholders**: Create shared understanding across teams
- **Identify gaps**: Reveal missing or weak elements in the model
- **Enable planning**: Provide foundation for strategy and operational planning
- **Attract investment**: Communicate business viability to investors
- **Guide decisions**: Ensure initiatives support the business model
- **Facilitate pivots**: Make it easy to test and adjust model elements

## When to Create

- **Startup Formation**: When defining the initial business concept
- **New Product**: When launching products with different business models
- **Strategic Planning**: During annual strategy sessions
- **Pivot Exploration**: When considering significant business model changes
- **Investor Presentations**: When pitching to investors
- **Team Onboarding**: As foundational context for new team members

## Best Practices

1. **Start Visual**: Use the Business Model Canvas as a collaborative visual tool.

2. **Test Assumptions**: Identify and validate key hypotheses before committing.

3. **Consider Unit Economics**: Ensure the model works at the transaction level.

4. **Balance All Elements**: Revenue is important, but so are costs and resources.

5. **Think Ecosystem**: Consider partners, platforms, and network effects.

6. **Plan for Scale**: Ensure the model works at current size AND at scale.

7. **Iterate**: Business models evolve—revisit and refine regularly.

8. **Connect to Strategy**: Ensure business model supports strategic goals.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Revenue-Only Focus**: Ignoring cost structure and required resources
- **Unvalidated Assumptions**: Not testing critical business model hypotheses
- **Misaligned Elements**: Components that don't work together coherently
- **Ignoring Competition**: Not considering how competitors' models affect yours
- **Underestimating Costs**: Failing to account for customer acquisition and support
- **Static Thinking**: Treating the model as fixed rather than evolving
- **Complexity**: Making the model too complicated to execute
- **Missing Network Effects**: Not considering platform dynamics
