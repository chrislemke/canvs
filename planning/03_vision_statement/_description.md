# Vision Statement

## Overview

A Product Vision Statement is a strategic document that defines the long-term aspirational future for a product. It articulates why the product exists, what problems it solves, who it serves, and how it differs from alternatives. The vision captures the essence of the product's purpose and serves as a north star that guides all product decisions, keeping teams aligned and motivated toward a shared future.

## Purpose

- **Provide direction**: Establish a clear destination that guides product strategy and decisions
- **Inspire and motivate**: Give teams a compelling reason to invest their energy
- **Align stakeholders**: Create a shared understanding of what the product is trying to achieve
- **Enable autonomy**: Allow teams to make consistent decisions without constant oversight
- **Filter opportunities**: Help evaluate which features and initiatives support the vision
- **Communicate externally**: Articulate the product's purpose to customers, investors, and partners

## When to Create

- **Product Inception**: At the very start of product development
- **Agile Project Kick-off**: To align new teams on product direction
- **Strategic Pivots**: When fundamentally changing product direction
- **Annual Planning**: Reviewed and refreshed during strategic planning
- **New Leadership**: When product leadership changes
- **Market Shifts**: When significant market changes require repositioning

## Who's Involved

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|

### 4. Key Benefit

### 5. Differentiation
What makes this product unique compared to alternatives

### 6. Aspirational Outcome
The future state or transformation the product enables

## Vision Statement Templates

### Geoffrey Moore's Template (Crossing the Chasm)
> "For [target customer], who [customer's need], the [product] is a [product category] that [unique benefits]. Unlike [competitors], our product [main differentiators]."

### Simplified Format
> "[Product] is for [target customer] who [statement of need]. We provide [key benefit] through [unique approach], unlike [alternatives] which [limitation]."

### Aspirational Format

## Best Practices

1. **Keep It Concise**: The best vision statements fit in one sentence or phrase. If team members can't remember it, it's too long.

2. **Make It Memorable**: Use clear, evocative language that sticks in people's minds.

3. **Focus on the Future**: Vision is about where you're going, not where you are.

4. **Be Inspiring**: The vision should motivate and create emotional connection.

5. **Stay Adaptable**: Revisit the vision regularly as markets and products evolve.

6. **Collaborate and Validate**: Test the vision with team members, stakeholders, and customers.

7. **Communicate Continuously**: Product owners must weave the vision into the fabric of the team through regular communication.

8. **Connect to Strategy**: Ensure the vision ties directly to company-level strategy.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too Vague**: Generic statements that could apply to any product
- **Too Tactical**: Focusing on features rather than outcomes
- **Too Long**: Cramming too much detail into what should be concise
- **Disconnected**: Not aligned with company mission or market reality
- **Static**: Treating the vision as set in stone rather than evolving
- **Top-Down Only**: Not incorporating input from the broader team
- **Unmemorable**: Language that doesn't inspire or stick
- **Solution-Focused**: Describing HOW rather than WHY and WHAT

## Tools & Templates

- **Documentation**: Confluence, Notion, Google Docs
- **Presentation**: PowerPoint, Keynote for stakeholder communication
