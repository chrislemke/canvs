# Elevator Pitch (Internal + External Variants)

## Overview

An Elevator Pitch is a concise, compelling explanation of what a product is, who it's for, and why it matters—delivered in the time it takes to ride an elevator (30-60 seconds). This document captures both internal and external versions of the pitch, ensuring consistent messaging while tailoring the emphasis for different audiences. The internal pitch aligns teams on product vision, while the external pitch captures customer and stakeholder attention.

## Purpose

- **Align teams**: Ensure everyone can articulate the product consistently
- **Enable selling**: Give sales, marketing, and team members ready-to-use messaging
- **Capture attention**: Create a memorable hook for potential customers
- **Drive conversations**: Open doors to deeper discussions and demonstrations
- **Test messaging**: Validate whether the value proposition resonates

## When to Create

- **Agile Kickoff**: During project initialization to align the team
- **Product Launch Prep**: Before going to market
- **Funding Rounds**: When pitching to investors
- **New Hire Onboarding**: To quickly communicate product essence
- **Trade Shows/Events**: For networking and booth interactions
- **Sales Enablement**: As foundation for sales conversations

## Best Practices

1. **Respect the Time Limit**: 30-60 seconds maximum. Practice delivering it.

2. **Lead with the Problem**: Start with what the audience cares about, not your product.

3. **Focus on Benefits, Not Features**: What outcome do users achieve?

4. **Be Specific**: Vague pitches are forgettable. Use concrete examples.

5. **Create Curiosity**: The goal is to earn the next conversation, not close the deal.

6. **Practice, Practice, Practice**: Pitches improve through iteration and feedback.

7. **Use Storytelling**: A brief story or example makes pitches memorable.

8. **Tailor to Audience**: Adjust emphasis based on who you're speaking to.

9. **End with a CTA**: Always have a clear next step in mind.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too Long**: Cramming in too much information dilutes impact
- **Too Technical**: Using jargon that audiences don't understand
- **Feature-Focused**: Listing features instead of explaining value
- **No Hook**: Starting with company history instead of audience interest
- **One-Size-Fits-All**: Using the same pitch for every audience
- **No Differentiation**: Sounding like every competitor
- **Weak CTA**: Not making clear what should happen next
- **Not Practiced**: Stumbling through delivery undermines confidence
