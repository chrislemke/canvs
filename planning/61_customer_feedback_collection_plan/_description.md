# Customer Feedback Collection Plan

## Overview

A Customer Feedback Collection Plan outlines the strategy, methods, and processes for systematically gathering, analyzing, and acting on customer feedback throughout the product lifecycle. Customer feedback is essential for understanding user needs, identifying pain points, and validating product decisions. At the end of the day, feedback isn't just something you collect—it's something you act on, and when done right, it can turn casual buyers into lifelong fans.

## Purpose

- **Understand customers**: Learn what users actually need and want
- **Validate decisions**: Test assumptions before building
- **Identify issues**: Discover problems before they cause churn
- **Prioritize roadmap**: Focus on highest-impact improvements
- **Measure satisfaction**: Track customer happiness over time
- **Build relationships**: Show customers you listen
- **Drive improvement**: Create culture of continuous improvement

## When to Create

- **Product Planning**: When establishing feedback loops
- **New Products**: Before and after launch
- **Feature Development**: Throughout the development cycle
- **Growth Initiatives**: When optimizing retention/conversion
- **Support Scaling**: When systematizing feedback
- **Regular Review**: Annual feedback strategy review

## Prioritization Framework

### Impact vs. Effort Matrix
```
             High Effort
                  │
     ┌────────────┼────────────┐
     │  Consider  │  Strategic │
     │            │            │
─────┼────────────┼────────────┼─────
     │  Quick     │  Do First  │   High
Low  │  Wins      │            │   Impact
     └────────────┼────────────┘
                  │
             Low Effort
```

### Categorization Dimensions
- Frequency: How often is this mentioned?
- Severity: How painful is the problem?
- Breadth: How many users affected?
- Alignment: Does it fit product strategy?

## Best Practices

1. **Define Clear Objectives**: Know what you're trying to learn before collecting.

2. **Use Multiple Channels**: Different methods reveal different insights.

3. **Make It Easy**: Reduce friction in providing feedback.

4. **Act on Feedback**: Collecting without acting destroys trust.

5. **Close the Loop**: Tell customers what you did with their feedback.

6. **Involve Cross-Functional Teams**: Get diverse perspectives on analysis.

7. **Track Continuously**: Treat feedback as ongoing, not one-time.

8. **Value Face-to-Face**: Interviews remain the most reliable for deep insights.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Collecting Without Acting**: Gathering feedback that never influences decisions
- **Survey Fatigue**: Over-surveying customers
- **Leading Questions**: Biasing responses with question design
- **Recency Bias**: Over-weighting recent feedback
- **Vocal Minority**: Letting loud voices dominate
- **Cherry-Picking**: Only hearing what you want to hear
- **Siloed Data**: Feedback not shared across teams
- **No Baseline**: Can't measure improvement without baseline

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Response Rate | % who respond to surveys |
| NPS Score | Net Promoter Score over time |
| CSAT Score | Customer satisfaction score |
| Feedback Volume | Amount of feedback received |
| Time to Acknowledge | Speed of feedback response |
| Action Rate | % of feedback leading to changes |
