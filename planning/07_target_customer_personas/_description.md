# Target Customer Profiles / Personas

## Overview

Target Customer Personas (also called Buyer Personas or User Personas) are detailed, semi-fictional representations of your ideal customers based on real research and data. They capture the key traits, goals, behaviors, pain points, and motivations of specific user segments, helping product teams build empathy and make customer-centered decisions. Personas transform abstract "users" into tangible people with names, faces, and stories.

## Purpose

- **Build empathy**: Help teams understand and relate to real users
- **Guide decisions**: Provide a reference point for product and design choices
- **Align teams**: Create shared understanding of who the product serves
- **Focus development**: Prioritize features that matter to target users
- **Inform marketing**: Shape messaging and positioning
- **Enable segmentation**: Distinguish between different user needs
- **Validate assumptions**: Ground product decisions in user reality

## When to Create

- **Product Discovery**: Early in the product development process
- **Market Research Phase**: When defining target market
- **Pre-Design**: Before starting UX design work
- **Strategic Pivots**: When expanding to new segments
- **Team Onboarding**: As foundational materials for new team members
- **Campaign Planning**: Before major marketing initiatives
- **Regular Updates**: Refreshed as user understanding deepens

## Who's Involved

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| UX Research | Leads persona research and development |
| Product Manager | Uses personas for prioritization, contributes insights |
| Design Team | Creates visual persona documents, uses for design decisions |
| Marketing | Uses for messaging, contributes market research |
| Sales | Provides customer insights and validates personas |

## Key Components

### 1. Demographics
- Name (fictional but relatable)
- Age, location, education
- Job title and company type
- Income level (if relevant)

### 2. Psychographics
- Personality traits
- Values and beliefs
- Interests and hobbies
- Lifestyle factors

### 3. Goals & Motivations
- What are they trying to achieve?
- Why do they want to achieve it?
- What does success look like for them?

### 4. Pain Points & Frustrations
- Current challenges and obstacles
- What's preventing them from reaching their goals?
- Frustrations with existing solutions

### 5. Behaviors
- How do they currently solve this problem?
- What tools and products do they use?
- What's their decision-making process?

### 6. Context
- When and where do they experience this problem?
- What triggers the need for a solution?
- What environment are they in?

### 7. Objections
- Why might they NOT use your product?
- What concerns might they have?
- What barriers exist to adoption?

### 8. Preferred Channels
- How do they discover new products?
- Where do they get information?
- What influences their decisions?

## Persona Types

### Primary Persona
The main user your product is designed for. Design decisions should prioritize this persona.

### Secondary Personas
Important users with slightly different needs. Accommodated when possible without compromising primary persona.

### Negative Personas (Anti-Personas)
Who the product is NOT for. Helps focus decisions and marketing.

### Buyer vs. User Personas
- **Buyer Persona**: The person who makes the purchase decision
- **User Persona**: The person who actually uses the product
- These may be different people, especially in B2B

## Inputs & Dependencies

- User interviews and ethnographic research
- Customer surveys and feedback
- Analytics and behavioral data
- Customer support and sales insights
- Market research reports
- Competitive analysis
- Social listening and community insights

## Outputs & Deliverables

- Visual persona documents (1-page summaries)
- Detailed persona profiles
- Persona cards for reference
- Empathy maps
- User journey context
- Presentation materials for stakeholder alignment
- Living personas linked to product tools (Aha!, Productboard)

## Best Practices

1. **Base on Real Research**: Build personas from actual user interviews, analytics, and data—not assumptions.

2. **Focus on Behaviors, Not Just Demographics**: What users DO and WANT matters more than their age or location.

3. **Limit the Number**: 3-5 personas maximum. Too many fragments focus.

4. **Include Goals and Frustrations**: These drive product decisions more than demographic data.

5. **Make Them Memorable**: Give personas names, photos, and quotable statements.

6. **Keep Them Living**: Update personas as you learn more about users.

7. **Connect to Product Work**: Link personas to features and user stories in your tools.

8. **Share Widely**: Post personas where the team can see them. Reference them in discussions.

9. **Include Negative Personas**: Knowing who you're NOT building for is equally valuable.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Assumption-Based**: Creating personas from internal opinions rather than research
- **Too Many Personas**: Having 10+ personas dilutes their usefulness
- **Demographics Only**: Focusing on age/location without behaviors and goals
- **Static Documents**: Creating personas once and never updating them
- **Unused**: Developing personas that sit in a folder and never inform decisions
- **Stereotype Traps**: Creating personas that reinforce biases rather than represent real diversity
- **Missing Negative Personas**: Not defining who the product is NOT for
- **Conflating Buyer and User**: Not distinguishing who decides vs. who uses
